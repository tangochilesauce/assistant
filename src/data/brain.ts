    "content": "# PL8 State — Last Updated Feb 24, 2026 (Session 9)\n\nThis is the boot-up file. Read this first every session.\n\n## What Happened This Session (Session 9)\n\n### Inventory Inputs Overhauled\n- **StepperInput component built** — Flowbite-style `[-] value [+]` with `type=\"text\"` + `inputMode=\"decimal\"`. No more browser number input fighting. Configurable step, green flash on save. Used across ALL inventory quantity fields.\n- **Fixed gallon ingredients** — lime, ACV, white vinegar changed from `pkg: 4` (per-case-of-4-gal) to `pkg: 1` (per-gallon). Prices divided by 4 to match. Dan enters gallons directly now. Deep Order math still works since unit is already 'gal'.\n- **Killed broken pkgsRounded math** — old code mangled decimals (0.75 became 8). Clean division now, no rounding artifacts.\n- **Deep Order copy text fixed** — gallon items no longer say \"cases\", just \"X gallons [ingredient]\"\n\n### Packaging Section Rebuilt\n- **Status column deleted** — old status values (\"~14,750\", \"Have 300\") migrated to quantities in Supabase\n- **Per-flavor caps/labels/seal-filled caps** — new 6-column flavor grid (like sauce inventory). Each stored in its own Supabase settings key (`tango_inventory_caps`, `tango_inventory_labels`, `tango_inventory_seal_filled_caps`)\n- **Labels tracked as estimated rolls** (hard to count precisely)\n- **Seal-Filled Caps added** as new item type (pre-filled seals in bags, estimated count)\n- **General items** (Empty Bottles, Seals, 6-Pack Boxes XL/Logo) stay in regular table with qty + note\n\n### Recipe Page — 5-Column Layout\n- Now shows: Ingredient | 1 Batch (lb) | 1 Batch (commodity) | 1 Olla (lb) | 1 Olla (commodity)\n- Both lb columns match style, both commodity columns match style (orange)\n- Fixed Mild subtitle — was saying \"add truffle oil\" (backwards)\n\n### Columns Breathe\n- All inventory tables widened from `px-2` to `px-4` padding\n- `whitespace-nowrap` on value columns to prevent wrapping\n- Format column for ingredients no longer crams \"25lb bag (112.5lb)\" into a tiny space\n\n### Database Cleanup\n- Removed stale \"Labels (Hot/Truffle/Mango/Thai/Sriracha)\" and \"Labels (Mild)\" split rows from Supabase materials\n- Removed generic \"Caps\" row (replaced by per-flavor grid)\n- Migrated all status-as-text values to proper quantity fields\n\n### Previous Session (Session 8)\n- Full production planning dashboard built in PL8 (6 connected sections)\n- Standalone Tango Dashboard retired — everything in PL8 Orders page\n\n### Previous Session (Session 7)\n- Production planning for Monday Feb 24 — 3 ollas (1 Hot, 1 Mild, 1 Sriracha)\n- Ingredient order for Deep finalized: 275lb carrots, 120lb garlic, 12gal lime, 28lb culantro, 20lb habanero, 28gal ACV, 50lb salt, 50lb red jalapeno, 50lb sugar\n- Cook Planner + Deep Order first built as standalone (vanilla JS), now in PL8\n- Key learning: ALWAYS do batch math FIRST, then build order list — garlic and lime were tight fits\n\n### Previous Sessions\n- Session 6 (Feb 19): Dreamwatch streak counter + calendar, YouTube sync, auto-scheduling, Vercel deploy cleanup\n\n## What Happened Last Session (Session 6)\n\n### Big Wins\n- **Dreamwatch Streak Counter + Calendar BUILT** — Full motivational system added to top of Dreamwatch page. Streak counter with drill-sergeant/encouraging messages, 60-day calendar strip (past 30 + future 30) with green (published) / amber (queued) / empty dots. Auto-scrolls to today.\n- **YouTube History Synced** — New Python daemon (`dreamwatch_calendar_sync.py`) fetches all published videos from YouTube API, populates `dreamwatch_calendar` Supabase table. 21 videos synced, 15 unique dates.\n- **Auto-Scheduling Engine Built** — Queue pairs auto-assigned to next empty calendar day at 5 PM ET. FIFO order. Writes schedule into metadata JSON for upload pipeline pickup.\n- **Leopard Upload Recovered** — Was stuck at 66% due to expired token + ServerNotFoundError. Re-authed, relaunched. Currently uploading, scheduled for Feb 20 5 PM ET.\n- **Deploy Cleaned Up** — Killed GitHub Pages workflow entirely. Vercel is sole deploy target. Removed basePath conditional from next.config.ts. Updated MEMORY.md.\n- **MEMORY.md Updated** — Added \"NEVER use localhost\" rule and \"Vercel only\" deployment info.\n\n### Sunday Feb 22 — Dream Beds Pipeline Rebuild\nDan wants to rebuild the entire Dream Beds pipeline on Sunday. Two PL8 todos created with due date Feb 22:\n1. **Rebuild Dream Beds pipeline script (unified daemon)** — Merge `dreamwatch_sync.py` + `dreamwatch_calendar_sync.py` into one daemon. Add launchd plist for auto-start on boot. Upload watchdog for auto-retry. FSEvents file watcher on `_ queue/` for fully automatic pipeline (drop pair → encode → upload → schedule → publish). The whole thing.\n2. **Switch Dreamwatch calendar display to Pacific Time** — Dan lives in PT. Calendar currently shows ET. Need to change: `dreamwatch-calendar-store.ts` (getTodayET → getTodayPT), `streak-header.tsx` (same), and `dreamwatch_calendar_sync.py` (store dates as PT instead of ET). Upload scheduling stays at 5 PM ET. Started the change but reverted — saving for Sunday.\n\n### Previous Sessions\n- Session 5 (Feb 18): DNS cleanup, 62K customer discovery, Amazon PPC analysis, Strategy C, 30-day plan, financial corrections\n- Session 4 (Feb 18): Financial excavation (149 statements, 11,069 txns), 7 analysis reports, Dan profile, 10 revenue opportunities, 2026 Action Plan\n- Session 3 (Feb 17): Brain page built, DTC email recovery planned, all brain files updated\n- Session 2 (Feb 17): Vercel deploy, Tango Dashboard, notes system, UNFI sub-project\n- Session 1 (Feb 16-17): Schedule import, deadline tags, Goals dashboard, financial sidebar\n\n### Key Discoveries\n- **Balance is -$300** (not $45 — updated from Dan tonight)\n- **11,472 email subs** out of 62K customers = massive untapped DTC potential\n- **Shopify Email = \"Messaging\"** in Shopify admin. Has 6 active automations still running, 2 drafts, 4 failed (from when DNS was poisoned).\n- **Amazon PPC works** but barely spending — bids likely too low to win impressions consistently\n- **Dan is NOT a traditional developer** — ships via AI tools. Freelance positioning should be \"AI-powered product builder\" not \"Node.js developer\"\n- **Madder single track not done until 2/22** — no DistroKid pre-upload, YouTube + socials release only\n- **Dan's birthday is October 5** (NOT February 22)\n- **Berlin Packaging owes $4,129** — Net 30, goal is pay at least half (~$2,064). Equal priority to rent.\n\n### Previous Sessions\n- Session 4 (Feb 18): Financial excavation (149 statements, 11,069 txns), 7 analysis reports, Dan profile, 10 revenue opportunities, 2026 Action Plan\n- Session 3 (Feb 17): Brain page built, DTC email recovery planned, all brain files updated\n- Session 2 (Feb 17): Vercel deploy, Tango Dashboard, notes system, UNFI sub-project\n- Session 1 (Feb 16-17): Schedule import, deadline tags, Goals dashboard, financial sidebar\n\n## The Real Financial Picture\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Monthly Revenue** | $6,900 (6-month avg

    "content": "# 2026 Action Plan — The Path to $50K/Month\n\n*Built from 7 years of financial data, market research, and Dan's full skills/asset inventory. February 18, 2026.*\n\n---\n\n## The Situation\n\n- **Current revenue:** $6,900/month (6-month average from actual bank deposits)\n- **Current burn:** $10,554/month (real, from statements)\n- **Monthly gap:** -$3,627 (credit cards have been filling this — now maxed)\n- **Total debt:** $40,475 across 7 credit cards at 25-29% APR\n- **Monthly interest:** $917 (money literally burning)\n- **Bank balance:** ~$45\n- **Net worth:** -$34,090\n\n**The crisis is NOT the business.** Tango is real — 12 years, 6 distribution channels, growing UNFI numbers. The crisis is the gap between revenue and expenses, which was filled with credit cards until they maxed out in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 0: Stop the Bleeding (THIS WEEK — Feb 18-23)\n\n**Goal: Prevent collections, overdraft, and further damage.**\n\n### Emergency Actions\n\n| # | Action | Cost | Impact | Deadline |\n|---|--------|------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | **Call Capital One re: Venture X** | $0 | Prevent collections on PAST DUE, OVER LIMIT account ($10,545). Ask for hardship program, reduced APR, or payment plan. | Feb 19 |\n| 2 | **Cut $175/mo in subscriptions** | Saves $175/mo | Topaz ($39), Fox One ($20), Netflix ($25), YT Premium ($14), Google One ($20), OpenAI ($20), Adobe ($23), Pika ($10), CapCut ($10) | Feb 20 |\n| 3 | **Use Chase ATMs ONLY** | Saves ~$53/mo | 64 non-Chase ATM withdrawals in 6 months = $320 in fees | Immediately |\n| 4 | **Delay rent to Mar 11** | Frees $2,878 for 10 days | Bridge until UNFI MOR arrives (~Feb 23) | Done |\n| 5 | **Confirm UNFI MOR timing** | $0 | $3,422 expected ~Feb 23 — this is the lifeline | Feb 19 |\n\n**After sub cuts + ATM fix:** Monthly burn drops from $10,554 to ~$10,326. Small, but it's $228/month that stops leaking.\n\n### Critical Payment Sequencing (Feb 18-Mar 11)\n\n| Date | Payment | Amount | Source |\n|------|---------|--------|--------|\n| ~Feb 17 | Amazon payout | +$561 | Incoming |\n| Feb 19 | Daylight shipping | -$400 | Must pay (production) |\n| ~Feb 23 | UNFI MOR | +$3,422 | Incoming |\n| Feb 23 | Deep ingredients | -$1,299 | Must pay (production) |\n| Feb 23 | Foodies hand-fill | -$1,100 | Must pay (production) |\n| Mar 1 | Off Record Studio | -$300 | Madder expense |\n| Mar 1 | Rent (DELAY) | -$2,878 | Push to Mar 11 |\n| ~Mar 21 | EXP invoice | +$3,400 | Incoming |\n\n**Cash flow after sequencing:** UNFI MOR ($3,422) covers Deep + Foodies ($2,399) with ~$1,023 buffer. EXP invoice ($3,400) covers rent ($2,878) with ~$522 left. It's razor-thin but it works.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Revenue First (Months 1-2, Feb-Mar 2026)\n\n**Goal: Close the $3,627 monthly gap. Revenue needs to go from $6,900 to $10,500+.**\n\n### The Three Fastest Levers\n\n#### 1. Restart Amazon PPC — $2,000-5,000/month uplift\n\n| Week | Daily Budget | Monthly Cost | Expected Revenue Lift |\n|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 1-2 (test) | $10/day | $300 | +$500-800 |\n| 3-4 (optimize) | $20/day | $600 | +$1,000-1,500 |\n| Month 2+ (scale) | $33-50/day | $1,000-1,500 | +$2,000-5,000 |\n\n**Focus:** Truffle first (63% of Amazon revenue, 70% margin, highest conversion). Then Hot and Mild.\n**Allocation:** 70% Sponsored Products, 20% Sponsored Brands, 10% Sponsored Display.\n**Target ACoS:** Under 30%. At 25% ACoS on $5K revenue → PPC cost $1,250, net gain ~$3,750.\n\n*This is the lowest-effort, highest-confidence lever. You're just spending money on products that already sell.*\n\n#### 2. DTC Email Reactivation — $500-1,000/month\n\n**The asset:** 3,000+ email addresses in Klaviyo\n**The fix:** Clean DNS (remove stale Klaviyo SPF/DKIM in IONOS) → Export list → Shopify Email (10K free sends/month)\n\n| Step | Action | Timeline |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Log into Klaviyo, confirm list accessible | Day 1 |\n| 2 | Clean DNS in IONOS | Day 1 |\n| 3 | Export list, import to Shopify Email | Day 2 |\n| 4 | Send \"We're Back\" re-engagement email | Day 3 |\n| 5 | 4-email sequence over 14 days | Days 3-17 |\n\n**Expected:** 3,000 × 20% open × 5% conversion = 30 orders × $30 avg = $900 first blast.\n**Ongoing:** $500-1,000/month with regular sends (2-4/month).\n\n#### 3. Close Costco with Moses — $3,000-5,000/event\n\nMoses Romero (Costco Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery) wants to discuss roadshows. **This is the door opening.**\n\n| Step | Action | Timeline |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Call Moses (T-F this week) | This week |\n| 2 | Discuss roadshow logistics, MOQs, regions | On call |\n| 3 | Complete food safety audit if needed (~$1,000) | 2-4 weeks |\n| 4 | First roadshow | 4-6 weeks |\n\n**Economics per roadshow:** $3,000-6,000 total cost → $3,000-5,000+ revenue per weekend.\n**Strategic value:** Success at roadshows → in-line Costco placement = $5K/month steady channel.\n\n### Month 1-2 Revenue Projection\n\n| Source | Current | After Levers | Change |\n|--------|---------|-------------|--------|\n| Amazon | $1,900 | $3,000-4,000 | +$1,100-2,100 (PPC) |\n| UNFI | $3,827 | $3,827 | — |\n| DTC | $328 | $800-1,000 | +$472-672 (email) |\n| Faire | $519 | $519 | — |\n| Other | $326 | $326 | — |\n| **TOTAL** | **$6,900** | **$8,500-9,700** | **+$1,600-2,800** |\n\n*Not yet at $10,500, but the gap shrinks from $3,627 to $850-2,050.*\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: New Revenue Streams (Months 2-4, Mar-May 2026)\n\n**Goal: Add $5,000-10,000/month from skills-based income.**\n\n### Freelance Development — $5,000-10,000/month\n\nDan's dev stack (Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, SwiftUI, Supabase, Vercel, AI automation) commands $100-200/hour on premium platforms.\n\n| Step | Action | Timeline |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 1 | Create Toptal profile | Week 1 |\n| 2 | Create Gun.io profile | Week 1 |\n| 3 | Portfolio: PL8, FFEEDD, Dream Beds pipeline, financial extraction pipeline | Week 1 |\n| 4 | Niche positioning: \"Full-stack Next.js + AI automation for small businesses\" | Week 1 |\n| 5 | Apply to 5-10 projects/week | Ongoing |\n| 6 | Land first client | Weeks 2-4 |\n\n**Target:** 1 client, 10-20 hrs/week at $100-150/hr = $4,000-12,000/month.\n**Why realistic:** Dan has shipped real products (not tutorial projects), and Next.js + AI automation is the hottest skill combo in 2026.\n**Risk mitigation:** Cap at 20 hrs/week max to protect Tango operations.\n\n### Tango Channel Expansion\n\n| Channel | Action | Expected | Timeline |\n|---------|--------|----------|----------|\n| UNFI NE | Get Mango into Northeast (follow up with John Lawson) | +$1,000/mo | 1-3 months |\n| Faire | Add all 6 flavors + multi-packs, Faire advertising | +$500/mo | 1-2 months |\n| Costco | First roadshow after Moses call | +$3,000-5,000/event | 4-8 weeks |\n\n### Ship FFEEDD — $100-500 initially\n\n**Status:** Built, launching at $1 upfront + $1/month after 60-day grace.\n**Month 1:** 15-50 downloads = $15-50 upfront.\n**Growth:** Product Hunt launch, Reddit posts, TikTok demos.\n**Long-term potential:** $5,000/month at 5,000 subscribers (12-18 month timeline).\n\n### Month 3-4 Revenue Projection\n\n| Source | Amount | Notes |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| Amazon | $4,500 | PPC scaled to $33-50/day |\n| UNFI | $4,000 | Stable + potential Mango NE |\n| Freelance dev | $5,000 | 1 client, 10-15 hrs/week |\n| DTC | $1,000 | Email sends ongoing |\n| Faire | $750 | Expanded listings |\n| Costco | $3,000 | First roadshow revenue |\n| FFEEDD | $200 | Early downloads |\n| Other | $500 | EXP, misc |\n| **TOTAL** | **$18,950** | |\n\n*If freelance dev hits and Costco roadshow succeeds, this is realistic by month 3-4.*\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Debt Destruction (Months 1-12, overlapping with revenue growth)\n\n**Strategy: Hybrid — Quick Wins + Avalanche**\n\nThe math only works when revenue exceeds burn. With Phase 1+2 levers, target is $15,000+/month by month 3. At that point, there's $4,500+/month available for accelerated debt payoff.\n\n### Attack Order\n\n| Priority | Card | Balance | APR | Why This Order |\n|----------|------|---------|-----|----------------|\n| **IMMEDIATE** | Cap One Starry | $276 | 26.40% | Kill it. Free $15/mo. Psychological win. |\n| **IMMEDIATE** | Cap One Platinum | $481 | 27.24% | Kill it. Free $25/mo. Two cards gone. |\n| **MONTHS 1-4** | Cap One Venture X | $10,545 | 28.49% | **EMERGENCY.** Past due, over limit, highest APR. Collections risk. |\n| **MONTHS 5-7** | Chase Amazon | $6,345 | 27.49% | Over limit, second-highest APR. |\n| **MONTHS 8-10** | Apple Card | $2,682 | 25.49% | Normal status, moderate balance. |\n| **MONTHS 10-11** | Amex | $1,000 | 25% | Small, lowest APR. |\n| **MONTHS 12-18** | Chase Sapphire | $19,147 | 26.74% | Largest balance, tackle with full freed payments. Consider balance transfer by then. |\n\n### Why Venture X is the Emergency\n\n- **Past due** = actively damaging credit score every day\n- **Over limit** = additional fees accruing\n- **Highest APR** (28.49%) = most expensive debt per dollar\n- **Payment bounced** = late fees + penalty APR risk\n- **Collections risk** = if it goes to collections, Dan loses negotiating power\n\n**Action:** Call Capital One this week.

(Check Chase Business)\n2. **PPC:** What's the ACoS? Scale up or pull back?\n3. **Debt:** Which card are we attacking? How much extra went to it?\n4. **Freelance:** Hours billed? Pipeline status?\n5. **Costco:** Roadshow update? In-line placement progress?\n6. **UNFI:** Sell-through numbers? Brittney check-in done?\n7. **Subscriptions:** Any new ones snuck in? Anything else to cut?\n8. **Cash:** Buffer above $2K? (Kill the Chase service fee)\n\n---\n\n## The Three Numbers That Matter\n\n| Metric | Current | Target (Month 6) | Target (Month 12) |\n|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Monthly Revenue** | $6,900 | $25,000 | $40,000+ |\n| **Monthly Net** | -$3,627 | +$14,674 | +$29,674 |\n| **Total Debt** | $40,475 | $22,500 | $0 |\n\n---\n\n## What Makes This Plan Different From Hope\n\n1. **Amazon PPC is not speculative.** Products already sell. This is just spending money to get more traffic to proven listings.\n2. **Freelance dev rates are market-confirmed.** $100-200/hr for Next.js + AI automation on Toptal/Gun.io. Dan has shipped real products.\n3. **Costco has a warm lead.** Moses asked about roadshows. That's half the battle for Costco entry.\n4. **The debt payoff math works** — it just needs revenue to exceed burn by $2,500+/month, which happens at ~$13,000/month total revenue.\n5. **Every lever has been researched with real numbers**, not estimates. PPC benchmarks, roadshow economics, freelance platform rates, subscription costs — all from actual data.\n\n---\n\n*This plan synthesizes data from 149 bank/credit card statements (2019-2026), market research across 6 opportunity categories, and Dan's complete skills/asset inventory. It feeds into the JEFF Board and brain file system for daily execution tracking.*\n",

    "content": "# Dan Frieber\n\n> \"Creative mastermind. Best artist.\"\n\n---\n\n## Who Dan Is\n\nBorn 1985, Morristown NJ. Jewish American father (Prudential corporate), Honduran immigrant mother (arrived ~3 years before marriage). Chaotic early childhood — moved constantly around NY/NJ, parents struggling with money and relationship. Landed in Bedminster around age 6, brother born, started school.\n\n**The entrepreneurial DNA is inherited from both sides.** Dad hated his corporate job, both parents dreamed of self-employment, mom eventually started her own home decorating/curtains business. Dad told 10-year-old Dan to hang leaflets and hustle lawn watering — Dan got 5 calls immediately. Has been self-employed in spirit ever since.\n\nNow 40, lives alone in a 2BR in LA. Good dual-monitor setup. Has been alone for ~3 years since a breakup, describes it as being \"dropped here by fate\" to learn about himself. This is a turning point moment — pressure from debt, back taxes, and Tango cash flow has forced a reckoning.\n\n**Bilingual:** English native, Spanish fluent (not perfect). Manages Tango's entire 7-person production team in Spanish — zero English speakers. Can take professional calls in Spanish.\n\n---\n\n## The Arc\n\n### Childhood & Early Hustles (1985-2003)\n- Lawn watering, babysitting, side hustles from age 10\n- Computer club kid in early 90s, natural with technology\n- **HTML in 6th grade** (~1997) — fell in love with coding and design immediately\n- Built websites including \"Daily-Junk\" (photos of high school kids) — went locally viral before Facebook existed\n- Started making websites for businesses as a teenager\n- Bass guitar obsession began in early high school (RHCP, Sublime, Rancid)\n- Worked at local snowboard shop\n- Co-founded the snowboard club at Bernards High School — literally went to the township and made it happen\n- \"Most Humorous\" at K-8 school\n- Weed at 15, at the music studio recording first band's EP\n- **Founded The Greenlight Group at age 16 (2001)** — a design/development agency serving local businesses in Somerset County, NJ. Grew to 3 employees and 25+ active clients. **Sold the business** when he left for college.\n- By end of high school: local legend on bass, prolific web designer, serial hustler, had already started and sold a business\n\n### Rutgers & Art School (2003-2009)\n- Started at Rutgers with no direction\n- **Lead Designer at Rutgers Dean's Office** (Oct 2004 - May 2006) — led a team of designers. Got this while still a student.\n- **Apple Store — Creative Genius/Personal Trainer** (Apr 2005 - Mar 2008, 3 years) — taught advanced creative software (Aperture, Logic) in private sessions and public classes in the store theatre. Was there when the iPhone launched.\n- Decided to leave Rutgers unless he could study art → applied to **Mason Gross School of the Arts** → accepted\n- **BFA in Art (Graphic Design)** from Mason Gross — formalized graphic design training, took existing skill to next level\n- Learned: design, branding, video, claymation, silkscreening, book binding, photography, darkroom, blogging, sculpture, painting, illustration, animation\n- **The rock star years** — had a successful touring band in college, packed 200-person house shows, \"the main rock star in the coolest band\"\n- Lived in 6+ houses with beautiful creative people\n- After band broke up, moved into psychedelic house, traveled to festivals across the country\n- Deep formative experience with community, creativity, and counterculture\n\n### NYC Era (2009-2020)\n- Highland Park NJ for a year (first time alone), got arrested for playing music with windows open while smoking a joint. 3 months probation — only time he's quit weed for more than 2 weeks since age 15.\n- **Creative Director, Priority Support** (Sep 2008 - Sep 2011, 3 years) — led art direction for IT/creative agency in NYC. Clients: Sherman's Travels, Traffiq, Pandora.com.\n- **Freelance Designer/Web Developer, MTV/Viacom** (Jun 2011 - Apr 2013, ~2 years) — designed and developed for NextMovie, Film.com, and other subsidiaries. Work seen daily by massive audience.\n- **Book Designer for Renate Aller** (Dec 2011 - Oct 2012) — designed a limited-edition hand-bound accordion art book, published by Radius Books, foreword by Dr. David Anfam.\n- **Freelance Designer, MKG** (2012) — Evian water campaign and 2012 rebrand.\n- **Freelance Web Developer, C42D Creative** (Jan 2013 - Oct 2013) — built responsive UIs and apps for Reebok, Smart Tap, Maverick's Lacrosse, Crabtree & Evelyn.\n- **Contracted Web Developer, Facebook** (May 2013 - Aug 2013) — responsive HTML+CSS web/mobile templates for high-traffic environments.\n- **UX Designer, RAPP** (Nov 2013 - Jan 2014) — UX and information architecture for Time Warner Cable.\n- Also did work for Equinox, Evian, Cleanmarket, and many more. Mostly direct client work.\n- Met Eric in Williamsburg, did 2-3 big client gigs (Eric developed, Dan designed). Eric was magnetic but not productive — partnership was short.\n- **Built Hyper** — social media app. Reddit meets Instagram: public photos posted to interest boards, ranked by popularity. 10,000 users, Cosmopolitan press, $250K offer in Israel. Failed because team couldn't develop fast enough to iterate on the spark. (Pre-AI — exactly the kind of thing Dan can now build with Claude Code.)\n- Got Tango into **Smorgasburg** (OG Brooklyn waterfront location)\n- **Tango Presents**: 50+ paid concerts across Brooklyn. Dan handled everything — booking venues, booking talent, promotion, equipment, photography. Full event production solo.\n- **Warehouse parties** (5 total, 100-400 people each) — full-scale event production with partner Gof. Music, Tango tacos, graffiti, costumes, rooftop, the works. Handled promotion, security, parking, bartending, sponsors — everything from scratch.\n- **Tango Chile Sauce born** — started as beloved product among friends, grew into a real brand\n- Got Tango into **Whole Foods**\n- Product placement on **HBO's High Maintenance** and **Master of None**\n- Lived in a Brooklyn house with 7 creative guys all making music and building things\n- Became known as \"the hot sauce entrepreneur from Brooklyn\"\n\n### LA Era (2020-Present)\n- Moved to LA with girlfriend during Covid. Broke up ~2022.\n- Alone in LA for 3 years — deep self-discovery period\n- Moved Tango manufacturing to West Coast during Covid\n- Introduced new flavors, grew accounts, got a $100K order\n- Dove deeper into audio production and beat making\n- **2025: AI revolution.** Started using Claude Code and AI tools. Unleashed creativity.\n- **In 3 months built:**\n  - FFEEDD — a polished iOS app\n  - PL8 — full business organization platform (includes orders/production dashboard)\n  - Dream Beds — fully automated YouTube channel\n- Now: in debt, owes back taxes, borrowing from mom to fund Tango batches. Needs income diversification urgently.\n\n---\n\n## Skills\n\n### Tier 1 — Master Level (decades, revenue-generating)\n| Skill | Depth | Market Value | Evidence |\n|-------|-------|-------------|----------|\n| **Visual Design & Branding** | 25+ years, BFA | $75-150/hr | Every pixel of Tango. Logos, labels, packaging, photography, social, web. Blue-chip client work (MTV, Facebook, Evian, Reebok). |\n| **HTML & CSS** | 30 years | Expert | Hand-codes from scratch since 6th grade |\n| **CPG Operations** | 12+ years | Very high — few people have end-to-end | Built Tango from scratch → UNFI, WF, Amazon, Costco, Faire. Cold-fill certified. Runs production at Foodies Mfg. |\n| **Retail & Distribution** | 12+ years | Extremely rare for a solo operator | Whole Foods, Costco buyer relationship, Amazon FBA, UNFI UpNext, Faire, Mable, EXP |\n| **Amazon Seller** | 5+ years | $100-200/hr consulting | Active FBA seller, PPC management, listing optimization |\n\n### Tier 2 — Professional Level (years of applied use)\n| Skill | Depth | Evidence |\n|-------|-------|----------|\n| **Music Production** | 20+ years | Ableton, FL Studio, bass guitar, FabFilter suite, Guitar Rig 7, Kontakt. 1000+ beats/songs, toured in college |\n| **Photography** | Film darkroom + digital | Shot all Tango product/brand photography |\n| **Video Production** | Active | Dream Beds pipeline, CapCut expert |\n| **Illustration & Fine Art** | BFA-trained | Painting, sculpture, silkscreening, animation, claymation, Procreate |\n| **Shopify / WordPress** | Professional (with reference) | Can build themes, customize, work in Liquid |\n| **Event Production** | 50+ events | Concerts, parties, brand activations across NYC |\n| **Spanish** | Fluent | Manages 7-person production team entirely in Spanish |\n| **Marketing & Copywriting** | Applied | Tango marketing materials, email campaigns, social content |\n| **Business Development** | Applied | Cold outreach to buyers (Moses/Costco, John/WF, Lauren/Erewhon) |\n\n### Tier 3 — Emerging Superpower\n| Skill | Evidence | Market Value |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| **AI-Directed Product Development** | Uses Claude Code as creative development partner. Designs every pixel, architects systems, breaks complex flows into buildable pieces. Shipped 4 real products in 3 months. This is creative direction + systems thinking + design taste → AI execution. Not \"prompting\" — product development with AI as the tool. | Emerging — rare combo of design sense + AI execution |\n\n### Important Context\nDan is a **designer**, not a developer. He never learned to code traditionally. Through AI tools (Claude Code), he ships production software — PL8 and FFEEDD are both real, functioning products. He doesn't know how good the code is under the hood, and couldn't debug a codebase manually or take a traditional freelance dev contract. What he CAN do is design and build complete products from concept to shipped.\n\n### Tools\n| Tool | Level |\n|------|-------|\n| Photoshop | Expert |\n| Illustrator | Expert |\n| Procreate | Expert |\n| CapCut | Expert |\n| Ableton Live | Professional |\n| FL Studio | Professional |\n| Claude Code | Daily driver, primary dev tool |\n| HTML/CSS | Hand-code, expert |\n| Shopify Liquid | Professional (with reference) |\n| WordPress | Professional (with reference) |\n\n---\n\n## How Dan Works\n\n**In flow:** Detail work. Design. Music. Can get lost in the details of almost anything visual or sonic. Obsesses over kerning, color values, pixel-perfect layouts AND big-picture brand world-building, story, visual systems. Both micro and macro.\n\n**With clients:** Good at it. Hates it. Can manage feedback loops, revisions, scope — but it drains him.\n\n**With AI:** This is the unlock. Dan's workflow is:\n1. See the whole system/product in his head\n2. Break it into logical flows and pieces\n3. Design every visual detail himself\n4. Use Claude Code as his development team to execute\n5. Iterate in conversation for weeks until every pixel is right\n\nThis is not prompting. This is a **creative director running an AI studio.**\n\n**Work capacity:** Can put in 10+ hours on a focused day. Dual monitor setup. Good enough internet.\n\n---\n\n## What Dan Wants\n\n### The Identity Shift\nDan has been an **underground artist** his entire life — incredible body of work, 1000 Instagram followers. He's done hiding. He wants:\n- A polished online presence he's proud of\n- Professional IG bio, accurate LinkedIn, real website\n- To be visible and recognized for what he's actually built\n- To stop being the best-kept secret\n\n### The Money Reality\n- **Dream since 25:** Automatic/passive income. Originally thought Tango would be the vehicle — produce once, collect forever. Reality: CPG is far more hands-on than expected.\n- **If money wasn't a factor:** Music production all day + designing fun products/things\n- **Real goal:** Monthly passive income from digital products (apps, YouTube, etc.)\n- **FFEEDD and Dream Beds are the dream projects** — they align with what he actually wants, not just what pays bills\n- **Tango is the engine** — real revenue and the difficulty is his moat, but the goal is to systematize it so it runs with minimal touch\n- **Short-term:** Diversified income streams beyond Tango\n- **Long-term:** \"Creative mastermind\" positioning. High-value work at the intersection of design, brand, and AI-directed product development.\n\n### The Naval Alignment\nDan identifies deeply with Naval Ravikant's thesis: in the AI era, the highest-value people are multi-dimensional creatives with taste, vision, and judgment who use AI as leverage. Dan is proof of concept — a designer/artist/entrepreneur who ships real products with AI. This is the direction he wants to build toward.\n\n### What He Doesn't Want\n- Public speaking (can do it, but rough)\n- To be pigeonholed as one thing\n- To go back to being invisible\n- Corporate bullshit\n\n---\n\n## Projects\n\n### Revenue-Generating NOW\n| Project | Monthly Revenue | Growth Levers | Effort to 2x |\n|---------|----------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Tango Amazon** | ~$1,900 | PPC restart (barely running), listing optimization | Low — just spend on PPC |\n| **Tango UNFI** | ~$3,400 | SKU expansion (Mango→NE), new regions | Medium — buyer relationships |\n| **Tango Faire** | ~$500 | More listings, marketing | Low |\n| **Tango DTC** | ~$300 | Email reactivation (3,000+ list), Shopify optimization | Medium |\n| **Tango EXP** | ~$3,400/quarter | Consistent reorders | Maintenance only |\n\n### Built, Ready to Ship\n| Project | Status | Time to Revenue | Potential |\n|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------|\n| **FFEEDD** | App built, launching | 1-2 weeks | $100-500 initially, $5K/mo at scale |\n| **Madder** | Single dropping 2/22, EP 3/3 | 3-6 months for any revenue | Festival path is the dream |\n| **Dream Beds** | Pipeline automated, 5 videos live | 6-12 months to monetization | $300-800/mo at 10K subs |\n\n### Backburner Products (Have UPCs, Ready to Produce)\n| Product | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| Dragon Jelly | UPC assigned, recipe exists | Korean chili paste market |\n| Buffalo sauce | UPC assigned | Mainstream appeal |\n| Gobblins | UPC assigned | Novelty/seasonal |\n| Mega Jerk | UPC assigned | Caribbean market |\n\n---\n\n## Network\n\n### Tier 1: Active Relationships with Business Value\n| Name | Role | Value | Status |\n|------|------|-------|--------|\n| **Moses Romero** | Costco Assistant Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery | **COSTCO ENTRY** — roadshows discussion | Active — call scheduled |\n| **Brittney Langlois** | UNFI UpNext SDM | Keeps Tango on UNFI shelf, monthly check-ins | Active — good standing |\n| **Adrian Lau** | Off Record LA studio owner | Music industry access (worked with Ice Spice, Fivio Foreign) | Active — 15yr friendship |\n\n### Tier 2: Warm Leads\n| Name | Role | Value | Status |\n|------|------|-------|--------|\n| **John Lawson** | Whole Foods buyer | SKU expansion into Northeast | Follow-up needed |\n| **Lauren Martinez** | Erewhon Brand Management | Premium retail placement | Warm lead from 2022 |\n| **Sean Momberger** | Grammy-winning producer | Music industry credibility (found sample for \"Not Like Us\") | Follows Dan on socials — door open |\n\n### Tier 3: Distribution Infrastructure\n- **UNFI** — Active vendor, UpNext program\n- **Amazon FBA** — Active seller account\n- **Faire** — Active vendor\n- **Mable** — Active vendor\n- **EXP International** — Active buyer (quarterly orders)\n- **Shopify** — Active DTC store\n- **Foodies Manufacturing** — Production partner (LA)\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Advantages\n\n1. **Real Product + Real Revenue** — Not a pitch deck. 12 years of CPG operations, real customers, real shelf space. $6,900/month from multiple channels.\n2. **Cold-Fill Certification Moat** — Tango's production is cold-fill (no heat treatment). Most co-packers can't do it. Better taste, workable margins.\n3. **Buyer Relationships** — Moses at Costco, Brittney at UNFI, John at WF, Lauren at Erewhon. Years to build, can't be bought.\n4. **Full-Stack Tech Skills** — Builds his own tools (PL8, FFEEDD, Dream Beds pipeline). No need to hire developers. Massive cost advantage for a solo operator.\n5. **Multi-Channel Distribution** — Amazon + UNFI + Faire + Mable + EXP + DTC. If one channel dips, others compensate.\n6. **Production Infrastructure** — Existing relationship with Foodies Mfg, ingredient suppliers (Deep, My Orchard), packaging vendors. Can produce on demand.\n\n---\n\n## Financials & Constraints\n\n### The Story in Numbers (7 Years)\n| Year | Revenue | Story |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| 2019 | $117K | Brooklyn peak — DTC + UNFI + wholesale |\n| 2020 | $68K | COVID + Brooklyn→LA transition |\n| 2021 | $62K | LA rebuild, finding new channels |\n| 2022 | $211K | **PEAK** — big wholesale orders + growth |\n| 2023 | $154K | Normalization |\n| 2024 | $87K | Declining, channels shifting |\n| 2025 | $76K | Growth in UNFI SoPac but overall down |\n\n### Critical Constraints\n| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |\n|-----------|--------|------------|\n| **$40K credit card debt at 25-29% APR** | $946/month in interest alone, 2 cards over limit | Revenue increase + expense cuts + possible balance transfer |\n| **~$45 in bank** | One auto-payment from overdraft, no emergency buffer | UNFI MOR (~Feb 23) is the lifeline |\n| **$2,878/month rent** | Largest single expense, 42% of revenue goes to rent | Need income to grow past it |\n\n### Structural Constraints\n| Constraint | Impact |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Solo operator** | Can't scale beyond personal capacity; every project competes for attention |\n| **Attention split (5+ active projects)** | None get full focus. Dream projects generate $0 but consume time |\n| **LA cost of living** | Rent, gas, food all premium. $8K/month is bare survival |\n| **Broken wrist (Jan 2026)** | Can't play guitar physically; limits Madder to production/mixing |\n\n### Behavioral Patterns (from 7 years of data)\n| Pattern | Evidence |\n|---------|----------|\n| Cash withdrawal habit | 12+ non-Chase ATM withdrawals/month, ~$600/month in cash + $60 in fees |\n| Smoke shop spending | $100-200/month consistent across years |\n| Subscription creep | $500+/month across 20+ services, many redundant |\n| Revenue volatility | Months range from $2K to $27K — no buffer to smooth |\n| Credit card spiral | 2025: went from $0 CC debt to $40K in 12 months |\n\n### The Path Forward\nThe business is viable. $6,900/month is real revenue with proven growth levers. The crisis is cash management, not business model. Double revenue to $14K/month and cut $200/month in expenses → stable. Triple revenue to $20K/month → debt payoff in 18-24 months.\n\n---\n\n## Online Presence (Feb 2026)\n\n### LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/danfrieber)\n- **Headline:** \"The bridge between your organization and AI.\"\n- **About:** AI-focused — systems-level thinking, building, not just planning.

Discovered ElevenLabs Seedance produces FAR better ambient motion than MidJourney Video. New pipeline: MidJourney render → Seedance (4-12s, 720p) → ElevenLabs Astra upscale (4K) → FFmpeg loop → YouTube. No slow-mo needed. Cheaper, faster, more realistic. 5 videos live (old pipeline). Ready to mass-produce with new pipeline.\n\n**The key insight:** Position as WELLNESS (not \"ambient music\") for 8x higher CPM ($10.92 vs $1.36).\n\n**The math to $5K:** At $10.92 RPM, need ~458K views/month. More realistic path: 50K subs + sponsorships from mattress brands ($500-5K/video).\n\n**Current milestone:** Hit 1K subs + 4K watch hours for monetization eligibility.\n\n**The brand:** \"Resting sanctuaries at the edge of vastness\" — sometimes cosmic, sometimes urban, always infinite-feeling. Different places where humans rest at the edge of eternity. That's not content. That's a thesis.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Daily uploads, hit 50+ videos |\n| **12 Months** | Make as much money as possible with almost no ongoing work |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Subscribers | 1 | 50,000 | 49,999 |\n| Videos | 21 | 50+ | 29 |\n| Total Views | 235 | 10,000 | 9,765 |\n| Watch hours | ? | 4,000 | ? |\n| Like Ratio | 100% | 95%+ | Done |\n| Monetized | No | Yes | — |\n\n### Revenue Milestones\n\n| Milestone | Timeline | Monthly Revenue |\n|-----------|----------|----------------|\n| Monetization (1K subs, 4K hours) | 3-6 months | $0 |\n| 10K subscribers | 6-12 months | $300-800 |\n| 50K subs + sponsorships | 12-18 months | $1,500-3,000 |\n| 100K subscribers | 18-24 months | $3,000-6,000 |\n\n### Revenue Streams\n1. **Ad revenue** — Main income at scale\n2. **YouTube Premium** — 15-30% of revenue for sleep content (background play)\n3. **Sponsorships** — Mattress brands at 50K+ subs ($500-5K/video)\n4. **Memberships** — Extended 10-hour versions at 25K subs\n\n---\n\n## Video Performance (Jan 24, 2026)\n\n| # | Title | Views | Like% | Scene | Notes |\n|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Luxury Penthouse High Above City | **25** | 0% | Urban | Best reach |\n| 2 | Ancient Palace (Egyptian) | **23** | 4.3% | Ancient | Fastest mover |\n| 3 | Overgrown Hideaway | 10 | 10% | Overgrown | Moderate |\n| 4 | Saturn Orbital Suite | 7 | **28.6%** | Celestial | Best engagement |\n| 5 | Japanese Mountain Temple | 2 | 0% | Ancient | Underperforming |\n\n### Patterns\n- **Ancient/Egyptian themes WORK** — Palace is fastest mover\n- **Urban/city vibes have reach** — Penthouse leading total views\n- **Celestial has best engagement** — Saturn fans more engaged\n- **Japanese/zen underperforming** — May need different angle\n- **Recommendation:** Double down on Ancient (Egyptian style) and test more Celestial\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n### Confirmed\n- **\"Impossible Sanctuaries\" brand position** — Bedrooms in places that couldn't exist in reality\n- **Underwater/aquatic is the niche** — Lowest competition, highest wellness CPM\n- **Wellness positioning = 8x CPM** — $10.92 RPM vs $1.36 for generic ambient\n- **3-hour format is optimal** — Not intimidating (vs 8-10hr), good ad inventory (70+ mid-rolls)\n- **ElevenLabs Seedance is THE video engine** — Replaced MidJourney Video entirely (Feb 2026)\n- **Seedance motion is realistic enough to skip slow-mo** — Direct loop without time multiplication\n- **ElevenLabs Astra upscale is THE upscaler** — 720p → 4K looks incredible\n- **Topaz API upscale models are GARBAGE** — Tested gcg-5, ghq-5, prob-4, rhea-1 — all terrible on AI video\n- **Topaz API slow-mo (Apollo) is good** — 2x and 8x both looked great, but unnecessary with Seedance\n- **Slow-mo before upscale** — If ever needed, always slow-mo at 720p THEN upscale (cheaper, better quality)\n- **No Bloom needed** — MidJourney source images work as thumbnails (just compress <2MB)\n- **NEVER use browser for YouTube** — Always YouTube Data API for uploads, scheduling, updates\n- **API scope needed:** `youtube` (full access), not just `youtube.upload`\n\n### Animation Capabilities (Seedance)\nSeedance handles realistic motion that MidJourney Video COULDN'T:\n- ✅ Moving water, rain, waterfalls\n- ✅ Swimming fish / sea creatures\n- ✅ Active flames, roaring fires\n- ✅ Realistic fluid dynamics\n- ✅ Fabric sway, curtain movement\n- ✅ Floating particles, dust motes\n- ✅ Cloud/nebula drift\n- ✅ Bioluminescent pulses\n\n**Seedance I2V prompt tips:**\n- Don't re-describe what's in the image — model can see it\n- Front-load motion verbs (first 20-30 words matter most)\n- Use intensity adverbs: \"gently,\" \"slowly,\" \"barely,\" \"subtly\"\n- NO negative prompts — can paradoxically introduce unwanted motion\n- One action per element\n- 30-100 words sweet spot\n- Use \"camera fixed. still\" in prompt for static shots (no dedicated UI toggle in ElevenLabs)\n\n### ElevenLabs (Seedance + Astra)\n- **Current plan:** Starter ($5/mo, 30,000 credits) — ~9 videos/month\n- **Recommended plan:** Creator ($22/mo, 100,000 credits) — ~32 videos/month ✅\n- **Extra credits (Creator):** $0.30/1000\n- **Seedance generation cost:** ~629 credits (4s clip) to ~1,888 credits (12s clip)\n- **Astra 4K upscale cost:** ~2,454 credits\n- **Per video (4s + 4K upscale):** ~3,083 credits\n- **Per video (12s + 4K upscale):** ~4,342 credits\n- **Concurrency:** 3 (Starter), 5 (Creator)\n- **No API for video yet** — UI only.

A megacity at night IS infinity to the nervous system.\n\n**Two lanes:**\n- **Lane A — Cosmic Sanctuaries:** Orbiting beds, cathedral-in-space, floating cloud temples\n- **Lane B — Liminal Urban Sanctuaries:** High-rise bedrooms, neon balconies, rain-soaked megacity overlooks\n\nBoth share: rest, night, vastness, quiet. That's a brand, not a contradiction.\n\n### Core Rules\n- Always a **resting posture** (bed, mattress, cushions)\n- Always **night or low light**\n- Always **warm foreground / cool distance**\n- Always **no people**\n- Always **a sense of looking out at something larger than you**\n\n---\n\n## Prompt Framework (4 Layers)\n\n### Layer 1: WORLD FOUNDATION (always paste)\n```\nA serene, hyper-real environment where a human-scale resting place exists at the edge of outer space.\nMassive cosmic scale contrasted with intimate comfort.\nNo chaos, no urgency, timeless, sacred calm.\nThe viewer feels protected while gazing into infinity.\n```\n\n### Layer 2: COMFORT ANCHOR (always paste)\n```\nForeground features a deeply comfortable resting setup: a bed or mattress with soft blankets, pillows, flowing fabric, warm textures.\nLow, grounded posture designed for rest, sleep, contemplation.\nWarm interior lighting, candlelight or soft ambient glow.\n```\n\n### Layer 3: COSMIC ANCHOR (always paste)\n```\nBeyond the resting space is open outer space: visible planets, star fields, nebulae, or glowing atmospheric curvature.\nVast scale, slow celestial presence, silent infinity.\nCool cosmic light contrasts gently with the warm interior glow.\n```\n\n### Layer 4: ARCHITECTURAL SKIN (swap this)\n\n**Miami Vice Balcony:** Pastel tones, smooth curves, glass railings, coastal luxury aesthetics. Open-air balcony floating in space.\n\n**Roman Cathedral:** Grand arches, carved stone, gold inlays, flowing drapery. Sacred, monastic luxury suspended in space.\n\n**Victorian Castle Balcony:** Ornate stonework, iron railings, candle lanterns, gothic elegance. A quiet balcony overlooking the cosmos.\n\n**Outdoor Camping:** Minimalist natural setting, grassy hill, blankets laid out beneath the stars. The ground itself floats gently in space.\n\n### Camera + Style Control (every time)\n```\nCinematic wide-angle composition. Symmetrical or gently balanced framing.\nSoft depth, no distortion. Hyper-real, physically plausible materials.\nDreamlike but grounded realism.\n```\n\n### Negative Prompt (mandatory)\n```\npeople, human faces, movement, action, text, logos, clutter, futuristic UI, cyberpunk chaos,\noversaturation, cartoon style, anime, sharp angles, harsh lighting, noise, blur, fisheye distortion\n```\n\n### Tuning Tips\n1. **Reduce perfection** — add \"slightly imperfect,\" \"lived-in,\" \"gentle asymmetry\"\n2. **Add liminal cue** — faint stars in glass, city lights blending into sky, atmospheric haze\n3. **Lower status signal** — fewer glossy highlights, softer materials, \"private refuge\" not \"penthouse flex\"\n\n---\n\n## Scene Categories\n\n| Category | Examples | Sound Elements |\n|----------|---------|---------------|\n| **AQUATIC** | Underwater domes, submarine bedrooms | Ocean, whales, bubbles |\n| **CELESTIAL** | Space stations, moon bases | Deep hum, cosmic noise |\n| **ATMOSPHERIC** | Cloud bedrooms, floating sanctuaries | Thunder, wind, rain |\n| **SUBTERRANEAN** | Bioluminescent caves, crystal caverns | Water drips, echo |\n| **OVERGROWN** | Dystopian ruins, solarpunk treehouses | Rain on glass, nature |\n\n### Theme Collections\n\n**Golden Ages:** 1920s Paris, 1930s Shanghai, 1950s Havana, 1970s New York, 1980s Tokyo, 1990s Miami, 1990s Berlin, 2000s Dubai\n\n**Ancient Luxury:** Ancient Rome senator's villa, 1700s Versailles, 1400s Florence (Medici), 1920s Cairo (King Tut era), 1890s Vienna (Klimt), Edo Period Kyoto\n\n**Film Genre Beds:** Noir detective's apartment, Hitchcock blonde's hotel, Spaghetti Western brothel suite, French New Wave Paris flat, Kubrick sterile future, Lynch red curtain room\n\n**Architecture Movements:** Art Deco penthouse, Art Nouveau Paris, Brutalist suite, Mid-Century Modern Palm Springs, Gothic Revival, Memphis Milano, Bauhaus, Googie atomic age\n\n**Music Era Beds:** Jazz Age speakeasy, Bebop NYC loft, Motown Detroit, CBGB punk loft, Studio 54 VIP, Haçienda Manchester, Seattle grunge apartment, Berlin techno warehouse\n\n**Weather/Elements:** Thunderstorm suite, Blizzard cabin, Monsoon penthouse, Fog bank tower, Sandstorm riad\n\n**Emotions/Moments:** Last night before wedding, Night you got the news, Can't sleep heartbreak, Just fell in love, Finally made it\n\n**Fictional/Literary:** Gatsby's bedroom, Bond villain's guest suite, Blade Runner replicant's apartment, Overlook Hotel room 237, Phantom's opera house lair\n\n**Transportation:** Orient Express private cabin, Titanic first class, Zeppelin suite, Submarine captain's berth, Sleeper train across Siberia\n\n**What Could Have Been:** If Rome never fell (2025), If Art Deco continued (NYC 1980), If Aztecs survived (Tenochtitlan 2025), If Tesla won (1950)\n\n---\n\n## Title Formula\n```\n[Wellness Trigger] in [Impossible Location] | [Sound Element] | 3 Hours\n```\n\n**Wellness Triggers:** Fall Asleep, Deep Sleep, Drift Off, Sleep Instantly, Rest Deeply\n\n**Sound Elements by Scene:**\n- Underwater: Ocean Sounds & Distant Whales\n- Space: Space Station Hum & Deep Bass\n- Sky/Clouds: Soft Thunder Below, Wind & Distant Rain\n- Cave: Water Drips & Echo\n- Dystopian: Distant City Hum, Rain on Metal\n\n---\n\n## Monetization Reminders\n\n1.

This is stark, focused, minimal.\n- **The aesthetic resonates** — Terminal/retro computing has a niche but passionate audience\n- **CaretlessTextView architecture** — Hide native caret via `tintColor = .clear`, NOT by overriding `caretRect()` (that breaks custom cursor positioning)\n- **Checkbox format needs space inside** — `[ ] ` not `[] ` — cursor lands after the space for immediate typing\n- **highPriorityGesture** — Use this in SwiftUI to make child taps override parent taps (checkbox vs entry expand)\n- **Keyboard dismiss timing** — Must call `resignFirstResponder` BEFORE transition animation starts\n- **Monetization DECIDED Feb 14, 2026** — $10 upfront launch (30-day test). Supreme pricing model — exclusivity IS the product. Can always drop to $1 but can never go up.\n- **Day One pricing: $49.99/year** ($4.17/mo) — industry benchmark. Has free tier + premium (validates freemium). Annual only, no monthly.\n- **2026 app pricing trend**: Subscriptions > one-time for retention + recurring revenue\n\n### Pricing Evolution\n1. Initially undecided (subscription vs one-time vs freemium)\n2. Considered $4.99/mo or $29.99/year freemium\n3. Decided $1 upfront + 60-day grace + $1/mo subscription\n4. **Final (Feb 14):** $10 upfront (Supreme model), test 30 days, fallback to $1 \"80% off\"\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Softer haptics (.soft, 0.5 intensity) | Feels better | Light haptics were too aggressive |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Doubled fade transitions (not tripled) | Better pacing | 0.6s compose, 0.6s edit, 1.0s feed, 2.0s splash |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Fixed cursor stuck top-left on edit | Works | CaretlessTextView can't override caretRect() to return .zero |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Added fade-to-black before opening posts | Smoother | 0.15s fade overlay before transition |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Fixed spam-enter race condition | No more duplicates | Added isSaving flag guard |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Rebuilt compose screen (CaretlessTextView) | Clean architecture | Unified with editor, removed 400pt inset hack |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Minimal ComposeActionBar (just cancel) | Cleaner UI | Matches editor's back button style |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Long press (0.2s) inserts checkbox | Works great | Inserts on new line with `[ ] ` format |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Checkbox auto-continue on enter | Works | Enter after checkbox line creates new checkbox |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Empty checkbox deletion on enter | Works | Removes empty checkbox, allows double-return to save |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Checkbox toggle from feed | Works | Tap checkbox area toggles, strikethrough on checked |\n\n---\n\n## Product Details\n\n**Core Concept:**\n- Green-on-black terminal style\n- JetBrainsMono font\n- Blinking block cursor as primary UI affordance\n- Double-newline to submit entries (like a terminal)\n- Dark mode only\n- **To-do list support:** Long press inserts checkbox, enter auto-continues, tap in feed to toggle\n\n**Tech Stack:** SwiftUI + SwiftData, UIKit integration for text input\n\n**Architecture:**\n- **CaretlessTextView** (shared) — custom UITextView with hidden caret via `tintColor = .clear`\n- Block cursor via UILabel positioned at caretRect()\n- ComposeActionBar / EditorActionBar — minimal action bars\n- **highPriorityGesture** — SwiftUI child taps override parent taps\n- **Keyboard dismiss** — `resignFirstResponder` BEFORE transition animation\n\n**Potential Pro Features (post-launch):**\n- Unlimited entries (free tier: X entries/month?)\n- Export (markdown, txt)\n- iCloud sync\n- Additional themes (amber, blue, white-on-black)\n- Widgets\n- Streaks/statistics\n\n---\n\n## App Store Optimization\n\n**Keywords (100 chars):**\n```\njournal,diary,retro,terminal,minimalist,dark mode,CRT,vintage,aesthetic,writing,notes,hacker,green\n```\n\n**Category:** Lifestyle (Primary), Productivity (Secondary)\n\n**App Store Description:**\n```\nWrite like it's 1985.\n\nFFEEDD is a journaling app for people who love the glow of a CRT monitor\nand the simplicity of a blinking cursor. No distractions. No cloud sync.\nNo social features. Just you, your thoughts, and a terminal.\n\nStart writing. The cursor is waiting.\n```\n\n**Screenshot Frame Captions:**\n1. \"Write like it's 1985\"\n2. \"Just you and the cursor\"\n3. \"Color code your thoughts\"\n4. \"Zero distractions\"\n\n**Visual Assets Needed:**\n- App Icon (1024x1024)\n- Screenshots (iPhone 6.7\", 6.5\", 5.5\") — 4-8 per size\n- App Preview Video (15-30 seconds)\n\n---\n\n## Launch Plan\n\n### Pre-Launch: Beta Testing via TestFlight\n**Goal:** 50-100 beta testers before launch\n**Where to recruit:**\n- r/journaling, r/TestFlight, r/retrobattlestations\n- Twitter with #buildinpublic\n\n### Launch Day Checklist\n- [ ] Verify app is live on App Store\n- [ ] Post to Product Hunt (12:01 AM PT)\n- [ ] Show HN post on Hacker News\n- [ ] Tweet announcement on all platforms\n- [ ] Email beta testers: \"We're live!

Free traffic. Expected: 500-2,000 organic downloads/month.\n2. **Viral/Referral** — \"Give a friend 1 month free / Get 1 month free.\" Share entry as image with FFEEDD branding. Expected: 0.2-0.5 viral coefficient.\n3. **Content Marketing** — Blog on ffeedd.us (SEO). Reddit (r/journaling = 1.4M members). TikTok (aesthetic content).\n4. **Paid Acquisition** — With $1/mo LTV of ~$6, need CAC under $2. Very difficult. Use sparingly.\n\n### Retention (Everything at $1/mo)\n\n| Monthly Churn | Users After 12 Months (per 1K starting) |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 10% | 282 |\n| 5% | 540 |\n| 3% | 694 |\n| 2% | 785 |\n\n**Retention tactics:**\n1.

StoreKit 2 integration\n2. Paywall screen\n3. Entitlement checking\n4. Restore purchases\n5. Free tier limits\n\n**P1 (Should Have):**\n1. Onboarding flow\n2. Analytics\n3. Push notifications\n4. Settings screen\n\n---\n\n## Marketing Ideas\n\n- **Product Hunt** — Terminal aesthetic will stand out\n- **r/terminal, r/unixporn, r/mechanicalkeyboards** — The aesthetic audience\n- **Developer Twitter** — Developers love terminal aesthetics\n- **TikTok** — ASMR-ish typing videos with the green cursor\n- **Hacker News** — If framed as a thoughtful, minimal tool\n- **Influencer Outreach:** Retro tech YouTubers (LGR, Techmoan, 8-Bit Guy), Productivity YouTubers (Ali Abdaal, Thomas Frank), iOS reviewers (Christopher Lawley), Journaling influencers\n\n---\n\n## Brand / Messaging\n\n- **Core tagline:** \"Write like it's 1985\" / \"Quiet personal thoughts\"\n- **Positioning:** Private journaling, no social features, no sharing, no followers.

Goal is to cancel Cargo, migrate DNS to Vercel (already used for PL8), and build a real personal site. Placeholder goes up first.\n\nDan is a product builder, entrepreneur, hot sauce founder (Tango), musician (Madder), app creator (FFEEDD), and creative technologist. The site should reflect all of that — not a generic portfolio, but something with personality.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- Cargo costs $14/mo (yearly) or $19/mo (monthly) — ~$168-228/year for static hosting\n- Vercel is free for personal projects, supports custom domains, auto-deploys from GitHub\n- Dan already has Vercel set up for PL8 (assistant-k5go.vercel.app)\n- Domain: frieber.com (already owned, currently pointed at Cargo)\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n- (nothing yet — fresh project as of Feb 24, 2026)\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Where is frieber.com registered? (need to know for DNS changes)\n- What's on the current Cargo site? Anything worth preserving?\n- What does Dan want the real site to be? Portfolio? Landing page? Blog?\n- What content/copy does Dan want on the placeholder?\n\n## Short-Term Goal\n\nCancel Cargo, deploy placeholder on Vercel, stop bleeding $14-19/mo.\n\n## Long-Term Goal\n\nBuild a real personal site that ties together all of Dan's projects and serves as an SEO hub (per the master revenue table in CLAUDE.md).\n\n## Action Queue\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] Cancel Cargo subscription\n- [ ] Set up new GitHub repo (frieber-site or similar)\n- [ ] Import repo to Vercel as new project\n- [ ] Update DNS records to point frieber.com → Vercel\n- [ ] Deploy placeholder page\n- [ ] Design real site\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n(none)\n\n### ⏳ Waiting\n(none)\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Added to PL8 as tracked project (Feb 24, 2026)\n- [x] Brain file created (Feb 24, 2026)\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n| Date | Finding | Expires |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| Feb 24 | Cargo charges $14/mo yearly or $19/mo monthly | — |\n| Feb 24 | Vercel Hobby plan: free, 50 custom domains, 100GB bandwidth, auto-SSL | — |\n| Feb 24 | Alternatives if needed: Cloudflare Pages (unlimited BW), Netlify, GitHub Pages | — |\n",

    "content": "# Madder — Brain\n\n**Target:** Festival performance | **Current:** Building | **Gap:** Define + execute\n**Weight:** 15% (2 hours/day dedicated)\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\nMadder is a music project. The primary goal isn't money — it's **performing at a major festival** (Coachella-level). Money would come later from streaming, merch, and performance fees.\n\n**The Sound:** Heavy riffs (Deftones influence) + electronic production + hip-hop elements. Hypnotizing chugs, deep distortion, addictive grooves. \"New Tool with smooth breakdowns.\"\n\n**Album:** MADDER — WHERE MY GUYS AT\n**Reference:** Deftones — *Around the Fur* (1997, mixed by Terry Date)\n**DAW:** Ableton Live 12\n**Plugin Suite:** FabFilter + Guitar Rig 7 + Kontakt (Shreddage 3.5 Argent, DjinnBass, Addictive Drums)\n\n**Time allocation:** 2 hours/day dedicated to music. TOP 4 project alongside Amazon, UNFI, and Costco — not because of revenue, but because it feeds the soul.\n\n**Status:** ✅ SINGLE DROPPED 2/22 on YouTube. EP (3-4 tracks) targeting 3/3. Nine days between drops = two marketing events.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | ✅ Debut single dropped 2/22. Drop EP 3/3. |\n| **12 Months** | Play Coachella. |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Monthly Listeners | ? | 50,000 | ? |\n| Live Shows | ? | 12/year | ? |\n| Festival Bookings | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\n---\n\n## Release Strategy: 2/22 → 3/3 Rollout\n\n- **2/22** — ✅ DONE. Dropped ONE single on YouTube. The statement piece. \"This is what this project sounds like.\"\n- **3/3** — Drop short EP (3-4 tracks). People who found the single now have a project to dig into.\n- Two Spotify release events > one album dump from an unknown artist\n- Single builds anticipation for EP. 9 days of momentum between drops.\n- Two dates to market around instead of one\n\n### Track Concepts (from 30+ grooves)\n- Track 1: Black focus vibe, defining riff, build up structure\n- Track 2: Hypnotizing chug → Gunna part, 80 BPM\n- Track 3: \"Depth and Aftertaste\" — starts VERY DISTORTED, expands throughout\n- *Pick the strongest groove for the 2/22 single. Remaining tracks become the 3/3 EP.*\n\n---\n\n## Action Queue\n\n| # | Action | Deadline | Status |\n|---|--------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | Write + produce the 2/22 single | Feb 18 | DO NOW |\n| 2 | Mix + master the single | Feb 19 | After #1 |\n| 3 | Create single artwork | Feb 16 | |\n| 4 | Upload single to DistroKid | Feb 16-17 | |\n| 5 | Set up Spotify / Apple Music profiles | Feb 16 | |\n| 6 | Create Canvas loop (3-8 sec) | Feb 20 | |\n| 7 | Write + produce EP tracks (3-4 songs for 3/3) | Feb 28 | After single |\n| 8 | Mix + master EP | Mar 1 | |\n| 9 | Upload EP to DistroKid | Feb 25-26 | |\n| 10 | Plan 2/22 + 3/3 release / promo strategy | Feb 20 | |\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n### Confirmed\n- **Sound:** Heavy riffs (Deftones) + electronic + hip-hop = hypnotizing chugs, deep distortion\n- **Core influence:** Deftones (Elite, Needles and Pins), target vibe: \"New Tool with smooth breakdowns\"\n- **NEW reference:** Black Sabbath — Paranoid sounds even better than ATF as a guitar tone reference\n- Goal is festival performance, not just streaming revenue\n- This is a passion project that feeds the soul\n\n### Production Breakthroughs (Feb 12, 2026)\n- **The 10kHz cliff:** ATF guitar stems have a hard low-pass cutoff at ~10kHz, not a gentle rolloff. Steep LP filter (48dB/octave) at 10k on guitars is the single biggest tone shaping move.\n- **Saturation before the cliff:** Saturn 2 (Tape/Warm Tube) BEFORE the low-pass generates harmonics in 3-8kHz that pack tight against the wall. That's the aggression without brightness.\n- **The chain that works:** Saturation pushing energy UP → Low-pass chopping it OFF → All energy packs into a tight band between the mid-hump and the cliff.\n- **Keyswitches are everything.** Argent articulation changes via MIDI notes below C-1.\n- **Velocity variation is critical.** All 127 = machine gun. Vary 60-125 to create dynamics.\n- **Skreamer (Tube Screamer) before Gratifier** with gain almost off, level cranked = tighter low end, more mids. The #1 trick.\n- **Less amp gain than you think.** Too much = wall of fizz. Skreamer + Saturn do the heavy lifting.\n\n---\n\n## Blockers\n\n| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |\n|---------------|-----|----------------|\n| Release | Album not finished | Finish tracks |\n| Videos | Need songs first | After album |\n| Physical playing | Broken wrist (Jan 2026) | Heal — can still produce/mix/be present |\n\n---\n\n## Music Industry Contacts\n\n### Active / Warm\n\n| Name | Role | Connection | Last Contact | Notes |\n|------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|\n| **Adrian Lau** | Off Record LA (studio owner) | **STRONG** — 15 years | Jan 23, 2026 | Worked with Ice Spice, Fivio Foreign.

Build local following (live shows)\n2. Release quality music consistently\n3. Get playlist placements\n4. Apply to smaller festivals\n5. Build festival resume\n6. Work with booking agent\n7. Apply to larger festivals\n\n### The Timeline\n- **2025** — Make next level songs\n- **2026** — Make videos so good people want to see them live\n- **2027** — Play Coachella\n\n---\n\n## Revenue Streams (Future)\n\n1. **Streaming** — Spotify, Apple Music (~$3-4 per 1000 streams)\n2. **Live performance** — Show fees ($500-5K+ depending on draw)\n3. **Merch** — T-shirts, vinyl, limited editions\n4. **Sync licensing** — TV, film, ads\n5. **Festival booking** — The dream\n\n---\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n| Date | Finding | Source | Expires |\n|------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Jan 22, 2026 | **Pre-saves are essential** — signals to Spotify algorithm, 20%+ save ratio gets Discover Weekly | LANDR | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Start pre-save campaign 3 months before release (we're late — start NOW) | Pitch-us | Immediate |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Countdown Pages require 5K active listeners — use DistroKid/third-party instead | Spotify | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Create Canvas (3-8 sec loop) — **4x more saves** than tracks without | Spotify | Before release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Email + SMS most effective for pre-save drives (98% SMS open rate) | Linkfire | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | 75% of first-year streams happen AFTER first month — post-release marketing matters | Spotify | Ongoing |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Sweet spot = 2-4 weeks pre-release for pre-save campaign | Pitch-us/LANDR | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Countdown Page Clips = 2x more pre-saves | Spotify | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | $20-50 in targeted Instagram/TikTok ads can outperform organic for pre-saves | iMusician | 2/22 release |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Coachella 2026 lineup: Sabrina Carpenter, Justin Bieber, Karol G headlining | Billboard | Info only |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | SXSW is key industry festival — plan for Nov 2026 deadline | Hypebot | Oct 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Many UK/EU festivals have open applications Jan-Feb | PRS M Magazine | Annual |\n\n---\n\n## Tone Bible (Ableton + FabFilter)\n\n### Philosophy\nATF's sonic fingerprint: **thick but not muddy, aggressive but controlled, mid-forward with surprisingly restrained low end.** Not a scooped metal mix — a dense rock mix with weight.\n\nBuild order: Drums → Bass → Guitars → Vocals\n\n### The A/B Stem Workflow\nWe have ATF stems AND MIDI recreations side by side. Calibrate in this order:\n\n1. **Drums first** — MIDI drums matching ATF stems\n2. **Bass second** — build on calibrated drums\n3. **Guitars last** — if you start here, you'll chase your tail\n\n**Three context tests:**\n- Test 1: ATF drums + ATF bass + YOUR guitar → does your guitar sit in the pocket?\n- Test 2: YOUR drums + YOUR bass + ATF guitar → is your rhythm section right?\n- Test 3: ATF drums + ATF bass + YOUR guitar → is your guitar tone right?\n\n### Kick Drum\n**Character:** \"Thock\" not \"boom.\" Pointed clicky attack (3-5kHz beater), solid punch (150-200Hz), controlled sub.\n\n| Freq | Action | Why |\n|------|--------|-----|\n| Below 80Hz | Cut | ATF kick isn't subby |\n| 150-200Hz | Boost | Punch zone |\n| 300-400Hz | Dip | Remove boxiness |\n| 3-6kHz | Narrow boost | Beater click |\n\nCompression: Fast attack (let transient through), medium release, 4-6dB GR. 1176/Distressor style.\n\n### Bass Guitar (Chi Cheng Tone)\n**Character:** Warm, round, slightly overdriven but not clanky. Pillowy low-mid foundation. You feel it more than hear it.\n\n| Freq | Action | Why |\n|------|--------|-----|\n| 40-80Hz | Present and solid | \"Felt not heard\" weight |\n| 100-250Hz | Full and round | Chi's zone, wall-of-sound with guitars |\n| 500Hz-1kHz | Slightly recessed | Don't compete with Stef's guitar zone |\n| Above 2kHz | Mostly gone | No string clank |\n\nCompression: Heavy but transparent. Slow attack, medium release, 6-8dB GR. LA-2A style.\nDrive: Warm tube breakup (SansAmp mild). If you can hear it as \"distortion\" you've gone too far.\n\n### Guitars (Stef Carpenter Tone)\n\n**The \"Terry Date Mid-Hump\":**\n\n| Freq | Action | Why |\n|------|--------|-----|\n| Below 150Hz | Roll off | Bass owns the lows |\n| 200-500Hz | Present but controlled | Body / chug territory |\n| 800Hz-2kHz | **THIS IS WHERE ATF LIVES** | All the aggression and grind |\n| 3-5kHz | Some bite | Presence without harshness |\n| Above 6kHz | Roll off | ATF guitars are NOT bright |\n\n**Signal Chain: Argent → Guitar Rig → FabFilter**\n\n*Argent Source:* Bridge pickup, transpose -1st (C#→Drop C), palm mute 35-40% tightness, all built-in FX disabled (raw DI out)\n\n*Guitar Rig 7 — Gratifier (Dual Rectifier):*\n1. Noise gate (tight)\n2. Green Scream (gain 1-2, level 7-8) — THE #1 TRICK\n3. Gratifier: Channel 3, Gain 5.5-6.5, Bass 4-5, **Mid 7-8**, Treble 5-6, Presence 4-5\n4. 4x12 V30 cab, mic off-axis\n\n*FabFilter post:*\n1. Pro-Q 3 — HP 100-150Hz, dip 300-400Hz, boost 800Hz-2kHz, rolloff above 6kHz\n2. Saturn 2 — Tape/Warm Tube, subtle grit → THEN steep LP at 10kHz (48dB/oct)\n3. Pro-C 2 — 2-3dB GR, evening dynamics\n\n**Double tracking NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Same riff, different velocities/timing, pan hard L/R.\n\n### The Frequency Handoff\n\n| Zone | Owner |\n|------|-------|\n| Below ~200Hz | **Bass** (Chi's domain) |\n| 200-500Hz | **Both** (intentional overlap = heavy wall) |\n| ~500Hz and up | **Guitars** (Stef's domain) |\n\n### Vocal Approach — Three-Layer Hybrid\n\n**Layer 1: Sampled/Processed Vocals** — Take existing vocals (soul, R&B) and recontextualize. Pitch down 2-3 semitones, granular stretch, distortion, long dark reverb.\n\n**Layer 2: Your Own Voice (Processed)** — Whisper or speak lyrics, drown in effects. Layer 5-10 takes. Vocoder. Heavy autotune as aesthetic.\n\n**Layer 3: Screams** — More forgiving than singing. Decent scream + right chain = massive.\n\n**The Chino Insight:** ATF vocals aren't technically virtuosic. What works: singing slightly uncomfortable = natural strain, floating melodic phrases about contour not pitch, whisper→scream contrast, heavy reverb/delay blurring voice and texture.\n\n### FabFilter Plugin Assignments\n\n| Plugin | Use |\n|--------|-----|\n| Pro-Q 3 | All EQ + spectrum analyzer A/B |\n| Pro-C 2 | Compression on tracks + buses |\n| Pro-L 2 | Master limiting / loudness matching |\n| Pro-R | Room reverb (drums), dark verb (vocals) |\n| Saturn 2 | Saturation — drum bus grit, guitar warmth, vocal distortion |\n| Pro-G | Gating — kick and tom tightening |\n| Pro-MB | Multiband compression |\n| Pro-DS | De-essing on processed vocals |\n\n### Other Key Plugins\n- DS Tantra — texture and sound design\n- Soundtoys Crystallizer — vocal effects, granular delay\n- Ohmicide — multiband distortion for aggression\n- Analog Lab V — synth textures\n\n### Reference Tracks\n\n| Track | Use For |\n|-------|---------|\n| My Own Summer (Shove It) | Kick isolation (intro), overall mix density |\n| Around the Fur | Guitar tone, bass/guitar handoff |\n| Be Quiet and Drive | Dynamic contrast, quiet-to-loud transitions |\n| Lhabia | Groove feel, drum character |\n| Headup | Low-end weight, aggression |\n\n---\n\n## Shreddage 3.5 Argent — Keyswitch Map\n\nThe 4 you'll use 90% of the time:\n- **C#-2** → Mute (chug)\n- **E-2** → Power Chord Mute (heavy chug)\n- **D#-2** → Power Chord Sustain (let it ring)\n- **G-2** → Choke (dead stop)\n\n**That's every Deftones riff: chug chug chug BOOM silence.**\n\nFull map:\n\n| Note | Articulation | ATF Usage |\n|------|-------------|-----------|\n| C-2 | Sustain | Open riffs, melodic lines |\n| C#-2 | **Mute** | THE CHUG — bread and butter |\n| D-2 | Staccato | Tight rhythmic hits |\n| D#-2 | **Power Chord Sustain** | THE BOOM after the chugs |\n| E-2 | **Power Chord Mute** | Heavy low chugs |\n| F-2 | Power Chord Staccato | Punchy accents |\n| F#-2 | Tremolo | Intensity building |\n| G-2 | **Choke** | THE SILENCE — dynamics |\n| G#-2 | Tapping | Not really ATF |\n| A-2 | Natural Harmonics | Rare — intro textures |\n| A#-2 | Artificial Harmonics | Rare |\n| B-2 | FX | Rare |\n\n### Velocity Programming\n\n| Articulation | Velocity | Feel |\n|-------------|----------|------|\n| Palm mute chugs | 80-110 | Varied |\n| Open power chord hits | 110-127 | LOUDEST — the payoff |\n| Accent notes | 105-115 | Slightly harder |\n| Ghost notes | 60-70 | Quiet texture |\n\nPattern should feel like speech: `100 80 75 105 85 125` not `127 127 127 127 127 127`\n\n### Argent Source Settings (WMGA / ATF Tone)\n\n| Setting | Value | Why |\n|---------|-------|-----|\n| Pickup | Bridge | Tight, defined attack |\n| Transpose | -1 st | C# default → Drop C |\n| Mute Tightness | ~35-40% | Looser ATF chug, not djent |\n| Vel → Tightness | Unchecked | Consistent character |\n| Anti-Repetition | ON, cranked | Max round robin |\n| DI Line Noise | Off | Guitar Rig handles tone |\n| Ringing | Unchecked | No sympathetic resonance |\n| Built-in FX/Amp/Cab | All disabled | Raw DI out |\n\n---\n\n## Shit to Try\n- [ ] Vocoder or voice synth\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- How much of the album is done?

    "content": "# JEFF — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nJEFF is the operating system for everything Dan builds. It's a Next.js web app deployed on **Vercel** (auto-deploys on every push to main), backed by **Supabase** for all persistent data. Plus a Claude Code slash command (/jeff) for conversational daily planning.\n\nThe philosophy: no scoring math, no rigid ranked lists. Show Dan the state of everything, let him pick. Priority is a story, not a formula.\n\n**Live URL:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n**Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Vercel > GitHub Pages for Next.js** — switched mid-session Feb 17. No more localhost crashes. Auto-deploys every push.\n- **Localhost dev server is unreliable** — crashes constantly, needs `lsof -i :3000 | xargs kill -9` to recover. Vercel made this irrelevant.\n- **Static export (`output: \"export\"`) works fine with Supabase** — all data is client-side fetched. No SSR needed for this use case.\n- **Supabase tables need manual SQL creation** — can't create via REST API with anon key. Run SQL in Supabase dashboard.\n- **Brain files are the soul of the system** — Claude reads/writes them between sessions, but Dan couldn't see them until the Brain page was built.\n- **Tags system is powerful** — JSONB tags on todos handle: focus, deadline, completed:DATE, archived. Flexible metadata without schema changes.\n- **dnd-kit closestCenter > closestCorners** — less finicky for 3-column layouts.\n- **IECU scoring model abandoned** — Original Prisma schema had impact (1-10), ease (1-10), control (1-10), urgency (1-3) scoring on todos. Dropped in favor of \"priority is a story, not a formula.\"\n- **Prisma/SQLite was the original DB** — Dormant schema still exists in repo. Models: Project, Goal (hierarchical), TodoItem (with scoring), Transaction (recurring support), Settings. Replaced by Supabase.\n\n### Platform Evolution\n1. **Vercel attempt #1 (early Feb)** — Full backend, auto-deploy. Disaster: webhook integration failed silently, deploy hooks returned PENDING but never materialized. Multiple re-imports failed.\n2. **GitHub Pages (Feb 15)** — Pivoted to static export. All data hardcoded in DashboardClient.tsx. Free, fast, actually worked. Deploy via GitHub Actions (~50s).\n3. **Supabase added (Feb 16)** — Client-side data fetching. Replaced hardcoded constants with Zustand stores + Supabase tables.\n4. **Vercel attempt #2 (Feb 17)** — Switched back. This time it worked. Auto-deploys every push to main. GitHub Pages deploy kept as fallback.\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Build JEFF into a usable daily tool — fully operational command center\n**12 months:** Replace Notion entirely as the single source of truth\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4\n- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Lucide icons, Geist font\n- **State:** Zustand 5.0.11 (5 stores: todos, notes, transactions, columns, dreamwatch)\n- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — 6 tables: todos, notes, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline\n- **Drag & Drop:** @dnd-kit/core 6.3.1\n- **Charts:** Recharts 2.15.4 (forecast, spending breakdown)\n- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub main branch)\n- **Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n##

    "content": "# Revenue Opportunities — February 2026\n\n*Research-backed opportunities ranked by time-to-revenue, effort, and potential.*\n\n---\n\n## Opportunity Matrix\n\n| # | Opportunity | Time to Revenue | Monthly Potential | Effort | Confidence |\n|---|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|------------|\n| 1 | **Restart Amazon PPC** | 1 week | +$2,000-5,000 | 2 hrs/week | HIGH |\n| 2 | **1 freelance dev client** | 2-4 weeks | +$5,000-10,000 | 40 hrs/mo | HIGH |\n| 3 | **Costco roadshows** | 2-4 weeks | +$3,000-5,000/event | 20 hrs/event | MEDIUM |\n| 4 | **DTC email reactivation** | 1-2 weeks | +$500-1,000 | 15 hours one-time | MEDIUM |\n| 5 | **UNFI Mango NE expansion** | 1-3 months | +$1,000/mo | 5 hours | MEDIUM |\n| 6 | **Ship FFEEDD** | 2-4 weeks | +$100-500 initially | Already built | LOW-MED |\n| 7 | **CPG consulting** | 1-2 months | +$2,000-5,000 | 10 hrs/mo | MEDIUM |\n| 8 | **Erewhon placement** | 3-6 months | +$2,000/mo | 10 hours | LOW |\n| 9 | **Faire/Mable growth** | 1-2 months | +$500-1,000 | 5 hrs/mo | MEDIUM |\n| 10 | **Music sync licensing** | 6-12 months | +$500-2,000 | After Madder releases | LOW |\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Breakdowns\n\n### 1. Amazon PPC Restart (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\n\n**Current state:** ~$66 spent over 60 days = basically nothing.\n**Benchmarks (Grocery/Gourmet category):**\n- Average CPC: $1.04\n- Average ACoS: 30.2%\n- Average conversion: ~10%\n- Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue, best margins (70%)\n\n**Recommended budget ramp:**\n| Phase | Daily Budget | Monthly | Expected Revenue Lift |\n|-------|-------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Week 1-2 (test) | $10/day | $300 | +$500-800 |\n| Week 3-4 (optimize) | $20/day | $600 | +$1,000-1,500 |\n| Month 2+ (scale) | $33-50/day | $1,000-1,500 | +$2,000-5,000 |\n\n**Budget allocation:**\n- Sponsored Products: 70% (best ROI for food)\n- Sponsored Brands: 20%\n- Sponsored Display: 10%\n\n**Focus:** Truffle first (highest margin, highest conversion), then Hot and Mild.\n\n**Target ACoS:** Under 30%. At 25% ACoS on $5K revenue, PPC cost = $1,250 → net gain ~$3,750.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Freelance Dev Client (FASTEST NEW REVENUE)\n\n**Dan's dev stack:** Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, SwiftUI, Supabase, Vercel, AI automation\n**Market rates:**\n- Toptal/Gun.io: $100-200/hr for senior Next.js devs\n- Upwork: $50-150/hr (median $63)\n- Next.js specialists command 15-35% premium over general React\n\n**Path to first client:**\n1. Create Toptal/Gun.io profile (1 day)\n2. Portfolio: PL8 app, FFEEDD, Dream Beds pipeline, financial extraction pipeline\n3. Niche: \"Full-stack Next.js + AI automation for small businesses\"\n4. Target: 10-20 hrs/week at $100-150/hr = $4,000-12,000/month\n\n**Why this is realistic:**\n- Dan has shipped real products (not tutorial projects)\n- Next.js 16 + AI automation is the hottest skill combo in 2026\n- 10 hrs/week is sustainable alongside Tango\n\n**Risk:** Time competition with Tango work. Mitigation: take 1 client, 10-20 hrs/week max.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Costco Roadshows\n\n**Economics (from research):**\n- Vendor fee: $35/day (4-day event)\n- Food safety audit: ~$1,000 (one-time)\n- 14% Costco markup on consignment\n- Foot traffic: 16,000-20,000 members per weekend\n- Minimum sales to qualify for more: $3,000/SKU/warehouse/weekend\n\n**True cost per roadshow:**\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n| Vendor fees (4 days) | $140 |\n| Product (samples + consignment) | $1,500-3,000 |\n| Shipping | $500-1,000 |\n| Staff (Dan + 1 helper, 4 days) | $1,000-2,000 |\n| **Total** | **$3,000-6,000** |\n\n**Revenue potential:** $3,000-5,000+ per weekend if product demos well.\n**Strategic value:** Success at roadshows → in-line Costco placement = the $5K/month channel.\n\n**Moses Romero wants to discuss roadshows.** This is the door opening.\n\n---\n\n### 4. DTC Email Reactivation\n\n**The asset:** 3,000+ email addresses from Klaviyo\n**The blocker:** Stale DNS records, Klaviyo account status uncertain\n**The fix:** Clean DNS → export list → Shopify Email (10K free sends/month)\n\n**Expected results:**\n- 3,000 list × 20% open rate × 5% conversion = 30 orders\n- Average order value ~$30 = $900 first blast\n- Ongoing monthly: $500-1,000 with regular sends\n\n**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to set up and send first campaign.\n\n---\n\n### 5. UNFI Mango NE Expansion\n\n**The data:**\n- SoPac (with Mango): +516% YoY\n- Northeast (no Mango): -9% YoY\n- Mango adds ~7 units/week net at WF\n\n**The blocker:** John Lawson response\n**The math:** Adding Mango to NE = ~$1,000/month additional UNFI revenue\n**Effort:** Follow up with John, submit paperwork, wait.\n\n---\n\n### 6. FFEEDD Launch\n\n**Status:** Built, launching at $10 upfront\n**Realistic month 1:** 15-50 downloads = $105-$350\n**Growth path:** Product Hunt, Reddit, TikTok → thousands of downloads\n**Long-term:** $1/month subscription × 5,000 subscribers = $5K/mo (12-18 month timeline)\n\n---\n\n### 7. CPG Consulting (NEW REVENUE STREAM)\n\n**Dan's unique knowledge:**\n- 12 years CPG operations\n- UNFI vendor (knows the process end-to-end)\n- Whole Foods placement experience\n- Amazon FBA for food products\n- Cold-fill manufacturing knowledge\n- Costco buyer relationship\n\n**Market rates for CPG consultants:**\n- Retainer: $1,000-3,000/month per client\n- Commission: 3-5% of sales generated\n- Brokers charge $1,000-$15,000/month depending on scope\n\n**Path:**\n1. Position as \"helping emerging food brands get into UNFI/Whole Foods/Amazon\"\n2. 1-2 clients at $2,000/month = $2,000-4,000/month\n3. Leverage existing relationships and knowledge\n4. Find clients through food/CPG communities, LinkedIn, Faire vendor network\n\n**Why this works:** Dan has the exact knowledge that emerging brands pay thousands per month for. He's literally living the playbook.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Erewhon Placement\n\n**Process:**\n1. Contact buyer (Lauren Martinez = warm lead from 2022)\n2. Submit via vendor portal (dashboard.erewhonmarket.com)\n3. Send samples via FedEx\n4. Bi-weekly tastings by Erewhon team\n5. <10% acceptance rate\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Non-GMO, USDA Organic preferred (check Tango's certifications)\n- Luxury packaging (may need label upgrade)\n- Reliable distribution capability\n- Strong brand \"feel\"\n\n**Revenue potential:** Premium pricing at Erewhon = higher margins. Estimate $2,000/month at 2-3 stores initially.\n\n**Timeline:** 3-6 months from submission to shelf.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Faire/Mable Growth\n\n**Current:** ~$500/month from Faire\n**Growth levers:**\n- More product listings (all 6 flavors + multi-packs)\n- Faire marketplace advertising\n- Seasonal promotions\n- Better product photography\n\n**Potential:** $1,000-2,000/month with active management.\n\n---\n\n### 10. Music Sync Licensing (Madder — Future)\n\n**Fee ranges for independent artists:**\n| Placement | Fee |\n|-----------|-----|\n| YouTube/micro-sync | $5-500 |\n| Indie film | $500-2,000 |\n| Cable TV episode | $500-5,000 |\n| Streaming (Netflix) | $500-5,000 |\n| National ad | $10,000-50,000 |\n\n**Platforms to register:** Musicbed, Artlist, Music Gateway, Sync Songwriter\n**Timeline:** After Madder EP drops (3/3), register tracks on sync platforms. Volume of licensable tracks matters — need 10-20+ songs.\n\n---\n\n## Revenue Ramp Projection\n\n### Conservative Scenario (Focus on top 3 levers)\n\n| Month | Amazon PPC | Freelance Dev | Costco | Other | Total |\n|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Current | $1,900 | $0 | $0 | $5,000 | $6,900 |\n| Month 1 | $2,500 | $3,000 | $0 | $5,200 | $10,700 |\n| Month 2 | $3,500 | $5,000 | $3,000 | $5,500 | $17,000 |\n| Month 3 | $4,500 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $6,000 | $20,500 |\n| Month 6 | $6,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $7,000 | $23,000 |\n| Month 12 | $10,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 | $30,000 |\n\n### What Makes This Realistic\n1. Amazon PPC: Just spending money on proven products. Not speculative.\n2. Freelance dev: Market rate for Dan's skills is $100-150/hr. 10 hrs/week = $5K-7.5K/month.\n3. Costco: Moses is the buyer and he's interested. That's half the battle.\n4. UNFI/Faire/DTC: Incremental growth on existing channels.\n\n### What Could Accelerate It\n- FFEEDD viral moment → sudden $5K+ month\n- Costco in-line placement (post-roadshow success) → $5K+/month steady\n- 2nd freelance dev client → $10K+/month\n- Erewhon placement → premium pricing lift\n\n---\n\n*This file feeds into the 2026 Action Plan.*\n",

    "content": "# Tango Chile Sauce — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nTango is a premium hot sauce brand with 6 flavors: Sriracha, Mango, Truffle, Mild, Thai, Hot. Revenue comes through multiple channels — Amazon (direct), UNFI (distribution to Whole Foods, etc.), EXP Corp, and emerging channels (Costco, DTC, Faire, Mable).\n\nThe business is real and generating ~$6,900/mo but the goal is $50K/mo by Q2 2026. The gap is $43,100/mo.\n\nProduction happens at Foodies (co-packing) with ingredients from Deep. Packaging from Acorn (boxes) and labels. Shipping via Daylight.\n\n**Channel vs Key Account distinction:** A \"Channel\" means you invoice them directly (Amazon, UNFI, Costco, EXP, Faire, Mable). A \"Key Account\" means they order through a distributor (e.g., Whole Foods orders via UNFI).\n\n---\n\n## Brand Identity\n\n**Name**: Tango Chile Sauce, LLC\n**Tagline**: Born in NYC, Made in LA\n**Established**: April 29, 2013\n**Federal EIN**: 46-2641462\n**FDA Number**: 11095246958\n**GS1 Account**: 30042269\n\n## The Origin Story (Short)\n\nWhen grandma first crafted her legendary chile in 1940s Honduras, she started with seven simple ingredients — most growing right outside her home. It started in her youth with a wild Scotch Bonnet plant that produced peppers every season.\n\nIt stayed small and honest at first — just family, neighbors, and friends. Then she started bottling it for the local market, where it took off. For a few bright years it lived out in the world, until she came to America and the recipe went quiet.\n\nIn 2015, she showed Dan her chile for the first time and it was over. He became obsessed. She showed him how to make it and he started making it naturally for himself, then for friends, then for stores, and Tango was born.\n\n*(Full timeline with dates from 2013–2020 in \"The Full Origin Story\" section below)*\n\n## Brand Voice\n\n**Personality:** Approachable but premium.

Honest about ingredients and process.\n**Words We Use:** Clean, whole food, carrot-based, Keto-friendly, no sugar added, small batch, craft, artisan\n**Words We Avoid:** Cheap, budget, discount, diet, low-cal, \"Just like TRUFF\"\n\n## Key Messages\n\n**Primary:** Truffle Tango delivers gourmet truffle flavor with clean, healthy ingredients — carrot-based, Keto-friendly, no sugar added.\n**Elevator Pitch:** \"Tango is the healthy truffle hot sauce.

A drum holds ~625 bottles. A standard olla yields ~400 bottles — roughly 2/3 of a drum. Mango yields ~450 (2 larger batches, higher volume per batch).\n\n### Cook Setup (Standard Tango — not Mango)\n3 ollas on 3 burners simultaneously. 4 batches per olla = **12 batches total per cook shift**. All ingredients get blended, brought to a boil, flame killed. Poured into drums (botes) to cool at room temp. Drums need ~2 days to cool before packing.\n\n**Truffle** is NOT a separate cook — it's the Mild recipe. Truffle oil flavoring is added right after cooking.\n\n**Mango** uses larger batches (2 per olla), so it's a different cook setup.\n\n### Process Flow\nIngredients (Deep delivers) → Prep → Cook (3 ollas, 3 burners) → Pour into drums → Cool 2 days → Pre-step: fill seals into caps (manual, ideally day before pack) → Pack: pneumatic piston fill (8oz) from drum → Hand-screw caps with pre-fitted seals → Label machine (2 at a time, foot pedal) → Inkjet date encoding on belt → Box into 6-packs → Case stickers (flavor-specific) → Palletize → BOL + invoice in pallet wrap\n\n### Production Costs (Per Run)\n| Item | Vendor | Cost |\n|------|--------|------|\n| Ingredients | Deep (My Orchard) | ~$1,300 |\n| Co-pack | Foodies (Aria) | $800-$1,000 (see shift costs) |\n| Bottles | Berlin | ~$0.28/ea (owes $4,100 as of Feb 2026) |\n| Boxes | U-LINE (Acorn too expensive at $804) | varies |\n| Labels | KSidrane (Zachary) | $695-$910 (see below) |\n| Shipping | Daylight (~$400, NOT needed for UNFI — they send own carrier) | $0-$400 |\n\n### Label Pricing — KSidrane (Quote #23728, Feb 17 2026, valid 30 days)\n**Contact:** Zachary Sidrane, ksidrane.com, (631) 393-6974\n**Account #:** 1228\n**Specs:** 4.6508\" x 3\" Special Shape Set, White BOPP + Matte Lamination, 4 Color Process, Permanent adhesive\n**Payment:** Credit Card (50% deposit, balance on shipment), FOB Farmingdale NY\n\n| Qty | Per 1,000 | Total |\n|-----|-----------|-------|\n| 1,000 | $490 | $490 |\n| 2,000 | $268 | $536 |\n| 5,000 | $139 | $695 |\n| 10,000 | $91 | $910 |\n\n**Note:** This quote is for **Mild labels only**.

PL8 Orders page handles most of this now but verify with Dan:\n\n### Step 1: Gather All Active Orders\nPull every PO that's in \"processing\" or \"new\" stage. Check:\n- PL8 Orders page (Supabase `tango_orders` table)\n- Plate drop folder for new POs not yet added to dashboard\n- Note the pickup dates — separate near-term vs later orders\n\n### Step 2: Total Bottles Needed by Flavor\nFor each order, multiply cases × 6 = bottles. Sum across all orders per flavor.\n\n### Step 3: Count Real Inventory\n**Don't trust the dashboard defaults** — ask Dan for actual counts. Need:\n- Filled bottles by flavor (already packed, ready to go)\n- Drums by flavor (sauce made but not yet bottled)\n- Half drums count as ~200 bottles (half of 400, NOT half of 625)\n- Already-built pallets are DONE — subtract those orders from the need\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Gap\nGap = Total Need − Bottles on hand − Drum bottle equivalents\nNegative gap = short, need to cook. Positive = covered.\n\n### Step 5: Plan Ollas\n- Standard ollas (Hot/Mild/Truffle/Thai/Sriracha): ~400 bottles each\n- Mango ollas: ~450 bottles each (2 larger batches)\n- 1 cook shift = 3 ollas max (4 hours, $400)\n- Prioritize by pickup date urgency\n\n### Step 6: Build Ingredient Order for Deep\nUse the per-olla ingredient lists below. Scale by number of ollas per flavor.\n**IMPORTANT:** Break down per-batch needs FIRST, then total across all ollas, THEN round up to purchasable units. Check for tight spots (where rounding down leaves you short) before finalizing the list. Garlic and lime juice are the most common tight spots when scaling down from the 3-olla reference.\n\n---\n\n### Feb 24 Cook Plan (CONFIRMED)\n\n**Orders driving this cook:**\n| Order | Channel | Pickup | Hot | Mild | Mango | Truffle | Sriracha |\n|-------|---------|--------|-----|------|-------|---------|----------|\n| PO #12165 | EXP Corp | Feb 28 | 300 | 180 | 180 | 60 | 120 |\n| PO #1102034 | UNFI HVA | Mar 25 | 216 | 504 | — | — | — |\n| **Total** | | | **516** | **684** | **180** | **60** | **120** |\n\n*Note: PO #1052998 (UNFI HVA, Feb 25 pickup) already palletized and done.*\n\n**Post-Cook Inventory (Feb 24 — cook complete, Sriracha short on garlic):**\n| | Hot | Mild | Mango | Truffle | Sriracha | Thai |\n|--|-----|------|-------|---------|----------|------|\n| Packed bottles (home) | 75 | 300 (wrong caps) | 0 | 0 | 40 | 200 |\n| Botes at kitchen | 1.5 (~937) | 1.0 (~625) | 2.0 (~1,250) | 0.5 (~312) | 0.3 (~187) | — |\n| **Total** | **~1,012** | **~925** | **~1,250** | **~312** | **~227** | **200** |\n\n**EXP order updated:** Sriracha back to 20 cases (120 btl).

Smooth & Spicy. Signature delicious Tango flavor with the perfect amount of heat you need. If you love hot sauce, start with Hot Tango.\n\n**Mild Tango** — Mild Tango is the perfect hot sauce for beginners. The subtle sweetness of the carrots and gentle spiciness of the scotch bonnet peppers works on everything. Kids can't get enough of it. Great on salads.\n\n**Thai Tango** — Thai Tango is the hottest sauce we've made yet. Fresh, spicy, sweet Tango with the heat turned all the way up. We added Thai chilies to the mix and they deliver a beautiful spicy flavor that doesn't linger on the tongue.\n\n**Mango Tango** — After years in the making, Mango Tango is finally here. Indulge in an exotic new world of sweet spicy delicious Mango Tango flavor. Enjoy fragrant ripe mangoes alongside limes, hot peppers and a touch of agave in this new Caribbean-inspired version of Tango.\n\n**Truffle Tango** — Truffle Tango is the original award-winning collaboration between two rising NYC food brands The Truffleist and Tango. Exceptional spicy truffle flavor in a healthful hot sauce guaranteed to take all your favorite meals to the next level.\n\n**Sriracha Tango** — Sriracha Tango is as close as we could get to the perfect Sriracha flavor we all love, while using only clean, simple ingredients.\n\n### Short Descriptions\n- **General:** Tango is crazy good spicy flavor in a plant-based chile sauce, made from 100% clean ingredients in a convenient 8oz squeeze bottle, perfect for adding delicious spicy flavor to your favorite foods.\n- **One-liner:** New carrot-based hot sauce hand-made in California from 100% clean ingredients.\n- **Tags:** Eco Friendly, Handmade, Made in USA, Dairy Free, Gluten Free, Keto, Paleo, Vegan, Vegetarian\n\n### Company Overview (for applications/pitches)\nTango is an up-and-coming brand of carrot-based Hot Sauce born in NYC, manufactured in Southern California. We offer 6 exceptional flavors — Hot (the original), Mild (less heat), Truffle (hint of truffle), Mango (sweet and fruity), Thai (extra hot), and Sriracha (clean simple Sriracha). 100% clean ingredients, carrot-based, packed with nutrients, no sugar, and no preservatives. Tango is Plant-Based, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Paleo, and tastes good on everything.\n\n### Differentiation Copy\nThe main difference that puts Tango above the rest is the flavor. There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise.\n\n---\n\n## RangeMe Pitch Templates\n\n**Erewhon:** Simply put, Erewhon is the highest level of grocery, and Tango is the highest level of hot sauce.

Tango is grandma's recipe, born and raised in NYC, where we are a hit in Whole Foods, Union Market, Freshdirect, etc. Tango would sell great in your stores, guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n## The Full Origin Story\n\nSince childhood, Dan always enjoyed the staple condiments and sauces, but it was in college that his love for spiciness and hot sauce took full bloom. His mom — born in Central America and raised on spicy cuisine — sneered at his American brands of sauce and told him just wait until he tries grandma's 'chile'. It wasn't until 2013 that she actually made a batch and he got to try it. It blew his mind.\n\nAfter a dozen batches, he ended up with his own version of her recipe. When friends tried it they went crazy for it, and when people wanted to buy quantity, he started taking things seriously. He was working as a graphic/web designer in NYC, so it was easy enough to find jars on Amazon, design a logo, print labels at home, launch on Shopify, and blast social media. 10 jars sold the first day, another 10 over the next month. But sales continued and feedback was always positive.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- **2014** — Tango officially certified by NYC Health Department and FDA\n- **Feb 2015** — Switched from 4oz glass jars to 8oz plastic squeeze bottles\n- **2015** — First of two seasons at Smorgasburg in Brooklyn (tens of thousands of visitors)\n- **Oct 2015** — Hired first employee\n- **Mar 2016** — Went slightly viral with \"Feel The Bern\" bottle supporting Bernie Sanders\n- **Mar 2016** — Tango Presents launched with sold-out Khruangbin concert at Rough Trade; 25 more concerts over the next year\n- **Feb 2017** — Moved into dedicated kitchen on Borden Ave, Long Island City (ending 3 years of random commercial kitchens)\n- **Apr 2017** — Switched from black caps to green caps\n- **Dec 2017** — Signed with UNFI (first distributor)\n- **Early 2018** — 75+ food stores & markets in/around NYC\n- **Apr 2018** — Gave Hot Tango a red cap to differentiate from Mild's green\n- **Aug 2018** — Finally hit Whole Foods shelves (after 5 rejections)\n- **2019-2020** — Expanded to hundreds more stores\n- **Late 2020** — Created west coast manufacturing plant, relocated to LA\n- **Current** — 20,000 bottles/month capacity, Sun Valley CA kitchen\n\n---\n\n## Files\n\n*Scanned Feb 20, 2026 from /Projects/🔥 tango/ (symlinked at /⚡ claudio/tango/).

Feb 20 campaign report (cumulative): 8 active campaigns, $159 spent, $497 sales, 3.12x ROAS overall. SD-REMARKETING paused (was 45% of spend, 0 sales).

Both S&S coupons renewed Feb 20: Truffle S&S (proven $226 winner) + new Sriracha S&S test. 3 new test campaigns launching: TT-CATEGORY, TT-HOT-HONEY, Pepper Plant PT.

Auto targeting finding great keywords at $0.17 CPC. Needs way more budget.\n- **Auto campaigns quietly outperform manual**: TT-AUTO-CLOSE (24x ROAS), TT-AUTO-SUBS (7x ROAS), SRIRACHA AUTO (21x ROAS) all beat manual campaigns.\n- **Truffle S&S coupon = 9:1 return**: 33 clips, 13 redeemed, $210.47 sales on $23.40 total cost.\n- **Competitor product targeting works for Truffle**: TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE gets sales by appearing on TRUFF's listing page (33% ACOS).\n- **2-packs convert better than singles**: Mild 2-pack (42.7%) vs Mild single (34.9%)\n- **PPC works when running**: 10x ROAS on \"truffle sauce\", 5.6x overall — just need to turn it on\n- **Brand searches convert**: \"tango hot sauce\" = 85% purchase share\n- **Post-holiday bid adjustment is critical**: Dec→Jan requires bid increases\n- **Phrase match > Exact match**: Phrase finds converting long-tail variations\n\n### Confirmed Failures\n- **Bundles are dead**: 648 sessions, $0 revenue across 7 SKUs. DELETED Jan 22, 2026.\n- **SD-REMARKETING is a money pit**: $42.68 spent (45% of all ad spend), 156 clicks, ZERO sales. Pause immediately.\n- **$3/day campaigns below the bid floor**: 14 TT- campaigns at $3/day got zero impressions.\n- **TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE inefficient at scale**: 81% ACOS. Keywords need audit.\n- **Flat file SUCCESS ≠ action taken**: Amazon processing confirmation unreliable for relationship changes.\n- **Don't fight TRUFF directly**: They own 77K searches for \"truff hot sauce\" — unwinnable\n- **Melinda's conquest doesn't work**: 2,179 impressions, 5 clicks, 0 sales — add as negative\n\n### Mysteries Solved\n- **Mango conversion \"problem\"**: 14.7% is market-rate for category (13.8% average). Not broken.\n\n### Key Gaps Identified\n- **\"truffle hot sauce\" conversion gap**: We get 3% of 17,573 monthly searches but only 1.4% of purchases.\n- **Sriracha invisible**: 22% conversion but only 177 sessions total. Outside variation family.\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Feb 20, 2026 | Coupon audit + renewal | All 7 coupons expired Feb 15-17. Truffle S&S was $226.66/34 clips/14 redeemed (25% budget). Renewed Truffle S&S + created new Sriracha S&S test. | Truffle S&S proven 9:1 return. 5 of 7 coupons were dead weight ($0 sales).

Defense targeting = sniper (18% ToS share). 3 new test campaigns planned. |\n| Feb 18, 2026 | Full campaign CSV report analyzed | 6 active, $137 spent, $446 sales, 3.24x ROAS. SRIRACHA AUTO 33x, TT-PT-DEFENSE 60x, TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE 3.8x (biggest earner). SR-PHRASE-TEST and TT-AUTO-LOOSE are losers (pause). | Bids still possibly too low — barely spending daily budgets. Defense targeting is a sleeper hit. |\n| Feb 12, 2026 | Full PPC + Coupon + Variation audit | SRIRACHA AUTO = star (21x ROAS). SD-REMARKETING = waste ($42.68/0 sales). Truffle S&S = 9:1 return. | Auto > manual. SD remarketing doesn't work. S&S coupons compound. |\n| Feb 11, 2026 | Uploaded v8 variation flat file | Deleted 2 dupes.

Position as healthier, better-value alternative.\n\n---\n\n## SKU Reference\n\n### SKU Generation History\n- **Gen 1 (Old):** TCSH, TCSM, TT — original SKUs (mostly gone)\n- **Gen 2 (Auto-gen):** GX-ELCK-FRPF, U4-ZJKD-O0BK — Amazon gibberish\n- **Gen 3a (Current no-dash):** TRUFFLETANGO, THAITANGO, MANGOTANGO — Amazon barcode (FNSKU required)\n- **Gen 3b (Manufacturer barcode):** HOT-TANGO, THAI-TANGO, etc. — no labeling\n\n**EXCEPTION:** TRUFFLETANGO stays active. TRUFFLE-TANGO saved for future own-UPC product.\n\n### Truffle Tango — Jimmy/Truffleist History\nJimmy from The Truffleist owns the UPC on current Truffle label. Collab since 2018 — he sends truffle flavoring, Dan manufactures all units, both sell independently (verbal agreement). Risk: manufacturer barcode = Jimmy's UPC, so Amazon could misassign inventory. Plan: new truffle product with Dan's own branding + UPC.\n\n### Product Lineup Vision\n**Core sauces:** 6 flavors × 4 pack sizes (1-pk, 2-pk, 3-pk, 6-pk) = **24 clean listings**\n**Future products:** Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk, Chips, Popcorn\n\n### Pricing Structure\n**Singles:** Hot $10, Mild $10, Mango $10, Thai $10, Truffle $17\n**2-Packs:** Hot $18, Mild $18, Mango $18, Thai $18, Truffle $30\n**6-Packs:** Hot $40, Mild $40, Mango $40, Thai $40, Truffle $75\n\n### Bundle Concepts (Bundles DELETED Jan 22 — 648 sessions, $0 revenue)\n*Historical reference only — bundles confirmed dead in hot sauce category*\n- Original Flavors: 1 Hot + 1 Mild — $18\n- Heat Seekers: 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $18\n- Starter Sauce: 1 Mild + 1 Mango — $18\n- New Flavors: 1 Thai + 1 Mango — $18\n- Heat Range: 1 Mild + 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $26\n- Tango Sampler: 1 Hot + 1 Mild + 1 Mango + 1 Thai — $34\n- Party of 5: 1 each of all — $40\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What's the right PPC daily budget ceiling before diminishing returns?\n- Should we kill Dragon Jelly (7.7% conversion, $390 total)?\n- Should we delete the 5 OOS six-packs (OOS 1-3 years)?\n- What's causing the \"truffle hot sauce\" conversion gap?

    "content": "# Tango x Costco — Brain\n\n**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month\n**Weight:** 15%\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\n**UNBLOCKED.** Moses call happened Feb 4, 2026. He's in. Roadshows are happening.\n\nThe format has pivoted from the old 16oz 2-pack idea to a **3-pack of 8oz bottles (Hot + Sriracha + Truffle) at ~$19 retail.** This is smarter — no new bottle size to develop, uses our existing 8oz format, and the perceived value is insane (Truffle alone is $17 on Amazon).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Moses assigns 5 Costco locations (mix of A/B/C stores)\n2. We demo our 3-4 best sellers across 5 stores in 5 days\n3. Target: $10,000 total sales revenue across the 5 days\n4. Ship 1 pallet per flavor per store ahead of demos\n5. Costco returns unsold product (consignment)\n6. After roadshow data, we discuss the \"club case\" — the permanent Costco offering\n\n**Timeline:** ~3 months from call (targeting May 2026)\n\n**The $10K target math:**\n- At $19/three-pack: 527 packs across 5 days = ~105/day\n- That's 1 sale every 3-4 minutes over an 8-hour demo day\n- Costco foot traffic is massive — doable but aggressive\n\n**Key insight from the call:** Moses initially said Dan picks 5 stores, then later said he'd assign an A store, 2 B stores, and 2 C stores. He's curating the locations — that's a good sign, he's thinking about this strategically.\n\n**Deck status (Feb 17):** We have a 3-slide roadshow proposal deck (Bootstrap HTML). Currently reworking the tone — less aggressive sales pitch, more collaborative proposal. Moses is already interested; we don't need to hard-sell. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Finalize 3-pack format, begin production planning for roadshow inventory |\n| **3 Months** | Execute 5-store roadshow, hit $10K sales target |\n| **12 Months** | Prove velocity → secure inline placement → $5K/month recurring |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Roadshows/month | 0 | 2 | +2 |\n| Units/roadshow | 0 | 400 | +400 |\n| Inline placement | No | Yes | — |\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Role | Email | Phone |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Moses Romero** | Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery | mosesromero@costco.com | 714-741-2208 |\n| David Liuzzi | Previous contact (moved desks) | dliuzzi@costco.com | 714-741-7787 |\n\n- Moses prefers **phone calls over email** — don't email, call\n\n---\n\n## 3-Pack Proposal\n\n### Product Format\n\n**Format:** 3 × 8oz squeeze bottles — Hot, Sriracha, Truffle\n**Retail price:** $19.00\n\n**Why this combo:**\n- **Hot** — OG best seller, always #1\n- **Sriracha** — Cheapest COGS ($2.74), clean Huy Fong alternative, massive category\n- **Truffle** — Premium differentiator, $17 standalone on Amazon, best TRUFF competitor on market\n- Sriracha and truffle are two of the most popular hot sauce flavors of all time — broad appeal in a Costco demo environment\n\n**Why $19 is genius:**\n- Truffle alone retails for $17 on Amazon\n- Customer gets 3 full-size bottles for $19 = insane perceived value\n- Trial machine — they taste 3 flavors, become repeat buyers across all channels\n\n### The Math\n\n| Component | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Hot COGS | $3.49 |\n| Sriracha COGS | $2.74 |\n| Truffle COGS | $3.34 |\n| 3-pack packaging (est.) | ~$0.75 |\n| **Total COGS per 3-pack** | **~$10.32** |\n\n| Line Item | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Retail price | $19.00 |\n| Costco's cut (~15%) | $2.85 |\n| **Tango receives** | **~$16.15** |\n| COGS | ~$10.32 |\n| **Gross profit per 3-pack** | **~$5.83** |\n| **Margin** | **~36%** |\n| Member value per bottle | $6.33 vs $9.99 retail (37% savings) |\n\n### Roadshow Revenue Scenario ($10K target)\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Target revenue | $10,000 |\n| 3-packs needed | ~527 |\n| Per day (5 days) | ~105/day |\n| Sales pace | 1 sale every 3-4 min |\n| Gross profit on $10K | ~$3,100 |\n\n### Inventory Exposure (5 stores)\n\n| Item | Quantity |\n|------|----------|\n| 3-packs to produce | ~1,250 |\n| Total bottles needed | ~3,750 |\n| Bottles per flavor | ~1,250 each (Hot, Sriracha, Truffle) |\n| COGS exposure | ~$12,900 |\n| **Risk mitigation** | **Costco returns unsold product** |\n\n### Recurring Revenue Path\n- $19/pack × 100 units/day × 4 days = $7,600/roadshow\n- 1 roadshow/month = ~$7,600\n- Inline placement = recurring without demo staffing\n\n---\n\n## Blockers\n\n| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |\n|---------------|-----|----------------|\n| 3-pack packaging design | Need to design sleeve/box for 3-pack | Source packaging options, get quotes |\n| Inventory production | Need ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) for 5 stores | Schedule cook + pack shifts with Aria |\n| Store assignments | Moses will assign A/B/C stores | Follow up with Moses closer to roadshow date |\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- ✅ **Positive taste reviews from David's team** (Aug 2024)\n- ✅ **Roadshow → Inline path confirmed** — Prove velocity first\n- ✅ **Moses is IN** (Feb 4, 2026) — Roadshows approved, 5 stores in ~3 months\n- ✅ **$10K target across 5 days** — aggressive but doable at $19/3-pack (~105 packs/day)\n- ✅ **Moses curating store mix** — 1 A store, 2 B stores, 2 C stores (he's thinking strategically)\n- ✅ **Costco returns unsold product** — consignment model, inventory risk is manageable\n- ✅ **3-pack pivot is smarter than 16oz 2-pack** — no new bottle size, better margins, trial-focused\n- ✅ **Hot + Sriracha + Truffle is the killer combo** — OG + trending + premium, $10.32 COGS for $19 retail\n- ✅ **Roadshows precede the \"club case\"** — Moses wants sales data first, then decides permanent format\n- ✅ **Demo your 3-4 best sellers** — Moses said to bring top flavors for demos, club case discussion comes after\n- ✅ **Deck messaging insight (Feb 17):** Don't tell the buyer how his store works. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions. \"Proposed format\" energy, not \"here's why we're right\" energy.\n- ✅ **Priority stack insight (Feb 17):** The deck is polish work. The load-bearing walls are: (1) Cash — how do we fund ~$12,900 in inventory by May? (2) Production — book Aria NOW. (3) Packaging — need quotes this week, 4-8 week lead time. The deck matters less than we think because Moses already said yes. Its real purpose is giving Moses ammunition to champion Tango internally — \"make Moses look good to his boss\" energy, not \"convince Moses\" energy.\n- ✅ **$10K reframe (Feb 17):** The $10K target is Moses's number. If we hit $7K, that's still incredible velocity data for inline placement. Don't treat it as pass/fail.\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Feb 17, 2026 | Reworking deck tone | In progress | Less salesy, more collaborative |\n| Feb 4, 2026 | **Phone call with Moses** | **🎉 ROADSHOWS APPROVED** | 5 stores, 5 days, ~3 months out. $10K target. He assigns A/B/C store mix. 1 pallet/flavor/store. Costco returns unsold. Club case discussion comes after roadshow data. |\n| Jan 15, 2026 | Moses sampling internally | Positive → led to call | This is the gate |\n| Jan 7, 2026 | Confirmed sample delivery | Delivered | Good to follow up |\n| Dec 23, 2025 | Sent samples to Moses | Delivered | — |\n| Dec 2025 | David intro'd Moses | New relationship | David moved desks, Moses is buyer now |\n| Aug 2024 | Discussed roadshow model | Interest confirmed | 16oz 2-pack + consignment model |\n| Jun 2024 | Sent samples to David | Positive reviews | Team liked the taste |\n| Apr 2024 | First contact with David | Relationship started | Long nurture cycle is normal |\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What does the 3-pack packaging look like? Sleeve? Box? Shrink wrap?\n- Exact Costco margin — is it really 14-15% or does it vary?\n- Which 5 stores will Moses assign? (He said he'll pick A/B/C mix)\n- Staffing: Can we hire demo staff or does Dan need to be there all 5 days?\n- What sampling supplies does Costco provide vs. what do we bring?\n- Do we demo individual bottles or the 3-pack itself?\n- What's the lead time from Moses confirming stores to demo dates?\n- Production capacity: Can Aria handle ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) on top of regular UNFI/Amazon orders?\n- Should we bring all 6 flavors for sampling even if the 3-pack is Hot/Sriracha/Truffle?\n- What does Moses need from us to finalize? Pricing sheet? Product specs?\n\n---\n\n## Roadshow Logistics Checklist\n\n| Item | Status | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 3-pack packaging (sleeve/box) | ❌ | Need to design + source.

    "content": "# Tango DTC — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales are currently $0 but the infrastructure is WAY bigger than we thought. DNS is now clean (Feb 19), Klaviyo lists are exported and segmented, and Shopify Email is the platform.\n\n**The Big Discovery (Feb 19):** Shopify has **62,007 customers** (3,806 orders) and **11,472 are email-subscribed** (18.5% of total). Klaviyo only had ~4,900 contacts — just 8% of the real database. The Shopify customer database IS the email goldmine, and Shopify Email has native access to all 11,472 subscribers natively. No CSV import needed for the main list.\n\n**The Email Situation:** Klaviyo was cancelled months ago due to poor deliverability + cost. DNS was poisoned with stale Klaviyo records until Feb 19 when Dan cleaned them all. Klaviyo lists were exported as CSV before the account potentially disappears. Shopify Email (10K free/mo, native integration) is the go-to platform.\n\n**Domain:** tangochilesauce.com. Email handled by IONOS. DNS is now CLEAN. Shopify store exists with 62K customers.\n\n**Strategy:** Warm up with Klaviyo-sourced Tier 1 VIPs (115 contacts) → expand to Tier 2 (987) → then unlock all 11,472 Shopify subscribers via native segments. 10K free Shopify Emails/mo covers the entire subscribed list in one send.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- Klaviyo deliverability was destroyed — domain had stale Klaviyo DNS records left behind\n- **DNS audit (Feb 17):** DMARC is solid (p=quarantine, 100%, reports to postmaster@). SPF had stale Klaviyo + SendGrid includes. DKIM had two stale Klaviyo signing keys still live. MX records clean (IONOS).\n- **DNS CLEANED (Feb 19):** Dan removed all stale records from IONOS panel:\n  - Removed `include:klaviyo-mail.com` from SPF\n  - Removed `include:sendgrid.net` from SPF (Klaviyo's SendGrid, NOT Shopify's)\n  - Deleted `kl._domainkey` CNAME (Klaviyo DKIM)\n  - Deleted `kl2._domainkey` CNAME (Klaviyo DKIM)\n  - Deleted `email` CNAME (pointed to Klaviyo SendGrid u161779)\n  - Deleted `pm-bounces` CNAME (pointed to Postmark pm.mtasv.net)\n  - Clean SPF is now: `v=spf1 include:_spf.perfora.net include:_spf.kundenserver.de ~all`\n  - Shopify's own SendGrid DKIM records (u36844960) kept — they authenticate Shopify Email\n- **Klaviyo list analysis (Feb 19):** Exported 3 CSVs from Klaviyo:\n  - File 1: 43 website signups — 88% open rate, 63% click rate, 56% buyers. THE GOLD.\n  - File 2: 11 SMS subscribers — tiny, includes Dan's email\n  - File 3: 4,845 legacy Shopify import — 72% never opened, 2,415 buyers, $78K total CLV\n  - Total unique: 4,881 contacts\n- **Segmentation results (Feb 19):**\n  - Tier 1 \"Inner Circle\": 115 contacts (website signups + 3-order repeat buyers who open)\n  - Tier 2 \"Warm List\": 987 contacts (subscribed + opened + accepts marketing)\n  - Tier 3 \"Long Shots\": 1,346 contacts (buyers who went dark)\n  - Dead List: 1,736 (never opened, never bought)\n  - Removed (spam/unsub/fake): 697\n  - Total sendable from Klaviyo: 2,448\n- **SHOPIFY HAS 62K CUSTOMERS (Feb 19):** Klaviyo only had 8% of the real database. Shopify's 62,007 customers (3,806 orders) are accessible natively through Shopify Email — no import needed.\n- **11,472 EMAIL SUBSCRIBERS (Feb 19):** 18.5% of 62K customers are email-subscribed in Shopify. This is the real sendable list — 4.7x bigger than the entire Klaviyo export. Shopify Email can send to this native segment directly.\n- **Shopify Email is the play** — 10K free emails/mo, no branding, native Shopify integration, native access to 62K customer database, zero extra cost\n- Email list is dormant — needs tiered re-engagement, NOT a blast to everyone\n- First email should NOT be a sale — \"we're back\" personal note to generate positive signals\n- Re-engagement math (revised with 62K): even 15% email-subscribed = ~9,300 sendable\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n- Klaviyo for email marketing — cancelled due to poor deliverability + high cost (date unknown, months ago)\n- Updated domain DNS settings when Klaviyo was cancelled — but left stale Klaviyo records behind\n- **DNS cleanup (Feb 19)** — removed all 6 stale records. DNS is now clean.\n- **Klaviyo list export (Feb 19)** — rescued all data as 3 CSVs before account potentially closes\n- **List segmentation (Feb 19)** — built automated script, segmented into 4 tiers + removed list\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- ~~What domain is sending from?~~ **ANSWERED: tangochilesauce.com, IONOS mail**\n- ~~What's the current SPF/DKIM/DMARC status?~~ **ANSWERED: DNS CLEANED Feb 19**\n- ~~Is the Shopify store set up?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, 62,007 customers, 3,806 orders**\n- ~~What email platform to use?~~ **ANSWERED: Shopify Email (10K free, native, no branding)**\n- ~~What's the current email list size?~~ **ANSWERED: Klaviyo had ~4,900.

Tango is my brand, I made my first batch in 2013 in\nmy tiny apartment in NYC, just trying to make my own blend of my grandma's\nfamous 'chile' that she used to make for her neighbors and friends in\nHonduras. I designed the logo, built the website, put it in the bottle,\neverything. 9 years and 6 flavors later, I still uphold the same ingredient\nlist and values that she promoted in her original creation. All clean,\ndelicious ingredients, no sugar or preservatives. Tango is a family\nbusiness, a labor of love. I still own 100% of the business, there are\nno investors involved. We wake up and eat Tango and then get to work\nmaking it. We love it, and we love anybody who loves it.. and that's everybody!\n```\n\n---\n\n# DM OUTREACH\n\n## Goal: 225 Reachouts/Day\n\n## Final DM Template (Tested Nov 2022)\n```\nHey [name]!

There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise.\"\n\n## Key Selling Points (Master List)\nCarrot-Based, Vegan, No Preservatives, No Sugar, No Gums, Plant-Based, Organic Ingredients, 6 Incredible Spicy Flavors, 100% Clean Ingredients, Easy-To-Use Squeeze Bottle, Handmade in Small Batches in CA, Grandma's Recipe, Born in Brooklyn, Rich In Vitamins, Gluten-Free, American Made, Family-Owned, Independent, Good on Everything, 98%+ sell-through rate, Cold-fill certified\n\n## Deep Tango Speech (Dan's Philosophy)\n\"There may be no more pursuit more shared by all walks of life than eating. Hot sauce, makes eating, better. Ideally in 5 ways: Adds flavor to your food, enhances all the flavors in the food, adds color, introduces spice-heat (a nervous system excitement mechanism). Hot sauce is also kind of a solidy liquid or a liquidy solid. It has pour physics. It incorporates so many qualities of the universe — Nature, Physiology, Sensation, Temperature, Physics, Flow, Chemistry, Fire, Flavor, Eating, Fun, Courage, Experience.\"\n\n## Tagline Ideas\n- \"Choose discomfort.\"\n- \"There's billions of tango fans most just haven't tried it yet\"\n- \"The only hot sauce you crave more than the food u put it on\"\n- \"Sauce so good it hurts\"\n- \"Flavor heaven\"\n- \"High quality Chile sauce\"\n\n---\n\n# E-COMMERCE FRAMEWORK (2022)\n\n## C x F x AOV\n- **C (Customers)**: Ads, Email, IG, Influencer, SEO, Content, PR, Website\n- **F (Frequency)**: Mainly email. Design 12 automated flows.\n- **AOV (Average Order Value)**: Post-purchase upsells, bundles, volume discounts, cross-sell at cart/checkout, increase free shipping threshold\n\n## 4-Step E-Commerce System\n1. Pick the right product that can be sold anywhere → \"The Healthiest Hot Sauce\"\n2. Maximize upfront purchase → Bundle offers, order bumps, post-purchase upsells\n3.

Extremely spicy (9/10). Available on Amazon.\n- **UPC:** 198168755891\n- **Sizes:** 2oz, 6oz, 8oz\n- **8oz jar:** 2.85\" diameter x 2\" height, 7.2oz filled\n- **Recipe (1x):** 9oz Thai chilies, 1 cup white vinegar (238g), 2.5 tbsp pectin (21g), 4 cups sugar (32oz), 7 drops food coloring\n- **Process:** Blend peppers + vinegar → cold pot → medium heat → add pectin → stir to hard boil → add sugar → repeat boil → flame off right before boil → hit 220-222°F\n- **Warning label:** EXTREMELY SPICY. Do not eat if sensitive to spicy foods, allergic to peppers/nightshades/capsaicin, pregnant, or have medical conditions. Keep out of reach of children.\n- **Key copy:** \"Unleash the flames within and breathe your fire with Dragon Jelly Tango\"\n\n### Tango Dust\nDehydrated sauce turned into chip seasoning. Concept phase (Dec 2025).\n- Yield: ~2oz dust per bottle\n- Alternative: buy raw ingredients (red jalapeno powder, garlic powder, salt, sugar)\n- For 200 units (10oz bags): ~125 lb chips ($200), ~3 lb seasoning\n- Best chip source: tortilleria chips from Mexican market\n- First dehydrator test (Cosori): 6H @ 135° was too little — took 15+ hours\n\n### Tango Gobblins\nSpicy gummies. UPC: 195893153879. Had bags designed for Tangofest (black, white, iridescent).\n\n### Mega Jerk\nUPC: 199284577152. No other details in archive.\n\n### Buffalo Tango\nUPC: 198168750254. No other details in archive.\n\n### Green Jelly\nRecipe experiment. Two versions tested (15oz peppers + sugar + water + jalapeno).\n\n### Tango Rub (Dry Seasoning)\nIngredient list: garlic powder, dried lime, salt, truffle, dried cilantro, dried habanero, dried carrot.\n\n## Tangofest\n\n**Concept:** \"Coachella meets Burning Man meets Art Basel\" — a first-of-its-kind celebration of creative spirit combining Art, Food, Music.\n\n**Tangofest 1:** August 1, 2025\n- 2000 sq ft indoor space\n- Free to attend, tight lottery\n- Food stations: Sriracha bites, Dragon Jelly bites, Spicy Tango Margs, Classic Tango station\n- Artists: Audi (host), Ian (Sriracha snacks), Jaff (Gobblins), Ladue (camera), Mari (jelly snacks)\n- Products debuted: Sriracha Tango, Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk, new label design\n- Budget: ~$770 (TOGO $150, Troy video $500, Amon recording $120)\n- Dream collabs: Tango x JNCO, MSCHF, Asspizza\n- Vision statement: \"Our definition of an artist is anyone brave enough to tango with the unknown long enough to pull something new and good out of it.\"\n\n## Historical Sales Data (2022 Baseline)\n\n**Amazon YTD (11/19/2022):**\nTruffle 925, Hot 389, Mild 281, Thai 39, Mango 11\n\n**Faire YTD (11/19/2022):**\nHot 1417, Truffle 1201, Mild 907, Mango 348, Thai 228\n\n**Shopify YTD (11/19/2022):**\nHot 112, Truffle 81, Mango 76, Mild 69, Thai 65\n\n**UNFI Annual (5/2020–4/2021):** $31,102 (88% supernatural, 4% supermarket independent, 3% supermarket chain, 3% natural independent, 3% ecommerce)\n**UNFI Annual (5/2019–4/2020):** $19,964\n\n**Key insight:** Truffle has ALWAYS been the Amazon star. Hot has always been the retail/Faire star. This hasn't changed in 4 years.\n\n## UPC Nightmare Context\nHot and Mild have conflicting UPCs because the originals (019962102103 / 019962102202) didn't match what GS1 registered (196852546671 / 196852812899) or what Amazon uses (653559973792 / 653559973839). Plan was to migrate to GS1 UPCs going forward and sunset the old ones. \"Problem children\" using old UPCs: UNFI, Nassau, EXP, Faire, Mabel. This is why the UPC Notes section in overview.md documents all three numbers.\n\n## Lancaster Non-Compete Clause\nDuring the term and for 3 years after expiration/termination, Lancaster agrees not to manufacture, assist in manufacture, or develop/sell products similar in taste, appearance, trade dress, or branding to Tango products. Breach = liquidated damages + immediate termination. (Lancaster was the NYC co-packer before moving to LA/Foodies.)\n\n## Testimonials (Early Days)\n- Denis Jasarevic (Gramatik): \"That, my friend, was one mighty fine hot sauce. Excellent work.\"\n- Various fans: \"I used the entire jar on two grilled cheese sandwiches,\" \"My eggs are bland without your sauce,\" \"Tango is bango\"\n\n## Nassau Candy (Distributor, Historical)\n- PO #2199847: 84 each of Hot, Mild, Truffle, Mango, Thai\n- Sep 2022 call: Hot & Mild performing better than others. Stores: Gorillas, Adam's Fairica, C-Town, Union Market, Solanga Market, Holiday Farms, Steve's Market\n\n## Food Safety Notes (CA Move)\n- Schedule process from NY valid in CA\n- LA County is the certifying body\n- Need: preventative controls, Certificate of Analysis for each ingredient, possibly Foreign Supplier Certification Process\n- Foodies Urban Kitchen maintains current food safety audit certifications (SQF/BRC/FSSC 22000 equivalent)\n\n## UNFI Food Safety Audit Promissory Note (Jan 2026)\nLetter drafted committing to provide UNFI with co-packing facility's food safety audit cert within 90 days. Tango address: 513 N Spaulding Ave, Los Angeles CA 90036.\n\n## Culantro Sourcing (Historical)\n**LA area (small qty):** Saigon Market (Gardena), Dat Moi Market (Gardena)\n**LA area (wholesale):** Long Produce, Panda Produce Inc\n**NYC area:** JCJ Produce (718-554-0716, Robinson — had truckloads), Coosemans (718-328-3060, Peter)\n**UC Davis** — biggest ag school in US, potential culantro growing research partner\n\n## Old SKUs Reference\n- Old Mild: TCSMI001\n- Old Medium: TCSME002\n- Old Hot: TCSHO003\n- Then: Original TCSO / TCSH\n- Current: see Amazon SKUs table in overview.md\n\n## Pallet Math\n- Europallet: TI 36, HI 6 = 216 cases = 1,296 bottles\n- 40x48 (updated): TI 48, HI 6 = 288 cases = 1,728 bottles\n\n## Misc From Archive\n- **Shipping tiers (DTC/old):** 1 bottle $5.99, 2 bottles $11.98, etc.\n- **Original recipe (home scale):** 500g carrots, 230g ACV, 30g garlic, 20g lime rind, 12g culantro, 16g peppers, 14g salt\n- **Bottle cost history:** 4oz glass jars (2013-2015) → 8oz plastic squeeze (Feb 2015+).

This brain file is the strategy/reference layer. PL8 is the operational layer.\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\nProduction runs through Foodies Urban Kitchen (co-packing with Aria) using ingredients from Deep (My Orchard). Process: Ingredients → Batches → Ollas (cook) → Drums (cool 2 days) → Bottles (pack) → Cases.\n\n**Current situation (Feb 17):** EXP pallet in progress (pickup Thu Feb 19, ~$3,400). UNFI MOR done (pays ~Feb 23). UNFI HVA done (pickup Feb 25).

We're in the UpNext emerging brands program.\n\n**Status:** SoPac is growing +516% YoY. Northeast needs SKU expansion (no Mango). Endless Aisle paperwork blocking new store access.\n\n### UpNext Crisis Context\nOn **May 21, 2025**, Brittney sent a termination notice. UpNext is a 2-year program — we've been in it since 2018 (7 years). Reason: \"not meeting sales thresholds for graduation.\" Decision reversed May 22 after Dan's response. Monthly check-ins established. **The $10K/month goal isn't just nice-to-have, it's survival.**\n\n### Core Philosophy: Density Before Scale\n\"Store count is vanity. Velocity is sanity.\" Brands that dominate two distribution centers before expanding have 3-4x better outcomes. Current WF velocity: ~1.6 units/store/week. Target: 3+ units/store/week = 2x current sales without adding stores.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Get to $10K/month ASAP |\n| **12 Months** | Graduate from UpNext ($300K annual) |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $3,400 | $10,000 | $6,600 |\n| SoPac YoY | +516% | Maintain | --- |\n| Northeast YoY | -9% | +20% | Needs Mango |\n| Store Count | ~50 | 200+ | +150 |\n| WF Velocity | ~1.6 units/store/week | 3+ | 2x needed |\n\n---\n\n## Growth Strategy Tree\n\n```\nUNFI $10K Goal\n├── Whole Foods (existing) ───────────── 25%\n│   ├── SoPac stores — GROWING +516% YoY\n│   └── Northeast stores — DECLINING -9% YoY\n│\n├── Whole Foods (expansion via John Lawson) ─ 25%\n│   ├── SKU expansion — get all 6 flavors\n│   └── New regions — Rocky Mountain, Midwest\n│\n└── New Store Outreach ──────────────── 50%\n    ├── LA/SoCal (65%) ← WHERE THE GROWTH IS\n    │   ├── Erewhon (10 stores) — TOP PRIORITY\n    │   ├── Bristol Farms + Lazy Acres (20)\n    │   └── Gelson's (27)\n    └── NYC/Northeast (35%)\n        ├── Wegmans (50)\n        └── DeCicco's (14)\n```\n\n## Revenue Math\n\n| Source | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Existing WF velocity | $3,400 | $4,500 | +$1,100 |\n| WF SKU expansion (John Lawson) | $0 | $2,000 | +$2,000 |\n| WF new regions (John Lawson) | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |\n| New LA chains | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |\n| New NYC chains | $0 | $500 | +$500 |\n| **Total** | **$3,400** | **$10,000** | **+$6,600** |\n\n## Why LA First?\n\n| Region | WF Stores | YoY Growth |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| SoPac (LA) | 48 | **+516%** |\n| Northeast (NYC) | 53 | **-9%** |\n\nLA is exploding.

Would open that door but adds distributor complexity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Role | Status | Last Contact |\n|------|------|--------|-------------|\n| John Lawson | Whole Foods buyer | Awaiting response | Jan 20, 2026 |\n| Lauren Martinez | Erewhon Brand Mgmt | Warm lead | Sep 2025 |\n| Zulma Cienfuegos | Erewhon Buyer (Purchasing) | — | — |\n| Maren Giuliano | Erewhon Buyer (20+ yrs organic) | — | — |\n| Brittney Langlois | UNFI UpNext SDM (blanglois@unfi.com) | Monthly check-ins | May 2025 |\n| Jennifer Warner Jo | UNFI Moreno Valley Buyer | — | — |\n| Shawn Lantry | UNFI Hudson Valley | — | — |\n| Catherine Garcia | UNFI Hudson Valley | — | — |\n\n---\n\n## Endless Aisle Paperwork Status\n\n**Location:** `/tango/distribution/unfi/endless aisle/`\n\n| Step | Form | Status |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 1 | Supplier Checklist | Done (existing supplier info) |\n| 2 | W-9 | Need fresh copy |\n| 3 | New Supplier Application | Fill with existing vendor info |\n| 4 | ACH Form | Need banking info |\n| 5-10 | Item Setup Documents | Use Moreno Valley specs |\n| 11 | Insurance COI | Get from RSC |\n| 12 | Food Safety Audit | Done (promissory note) |\n| 13 | Quality Assurance Agreement | Review and sign |\n\n---\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n| Date | Finding | Source | Expires |\n|------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Erewhon uses KeHE, NOT UNFI — UNFI distribution doesn't help here | KeHE press release | Ongoing |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Bristol Farms uses RangeMe — submit there + direct outreach | Research | Ongoing |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Gelson's = premium LA positioning — fits Tango, same UNFI DC | Research | Ongoing |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening West Hollywood Feb 2026 | WestsideCurrent | Feb 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening Glendale May 2026 | WestsideCurrent | May 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening Thousand Oaks July 2026 | Conejo Valley Guide | July 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening NYC flagship late 2026 — first East Coast location | Modern Retail | Q4 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon vendor requirements: Non-GMO + USDA Organic preferred, no refined sugar | Modern Retail | Ongoing |\n\n---\n\n*Migrated from Notion (Tango x UNFI) — Feb 17, 2026*\n",
