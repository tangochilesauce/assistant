    "content": "# JEFF — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nJEFF is the operating system for everything Dan builds. It's a Next.js web app deployed on **Vercel** (auto-deploys on every push to main), backed by **Supabase** for all persistent data. Plus a Claude Code slash command (/jeff) for conversational daily planning.\n\nThe philosophy: no scoring math, no rigid ranked lists. Show Dan the state of everything, let him pick. Priority is a story, not a formula.\n\n**Live URL:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n**Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Vercel > GitHub Pages for Next.js** — switched mid-session Feb 17. No more localhost crashes. Auto-deploys every push.\n- **Localhost dev server is unreliable** — crashes constantly, needs `lsof -i :3000 | xargs kill -9` to recover. Vercel made this irrelevant.\n- **Static export (`output: \"export\"`) works fine with Supabase** — all data is client-side fetched. No SSR needed for this use case.\n- **Supabase tables need manual SQL creation** — can't create via REST API with anon key. Run SQL in Supabase dashboard.\n- **Brain files are the soul of the system** — Claude reads/writes them between sessions, but Dan couldn't see them until the Brain page was built.\n- **Tags system is powerful** — JSONB tags on todos handle: focus, deadline, completed:DATE, archived. Flexible metadata without schema changes.\n- **dnd-kit closestCenter > closestCorners** — less finicky for 3-column layouts.\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Build JEFF into a usable daily tool — fully operational command center\n**12 months:** Replace Notion entirely as the single source of truth\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4\n- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Lucide icons, Geist font\n- **State:** Zustand 5.0.11 (5 stores: todos, notes, transactions, columns, dreamwatch)\n- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — 6 tables: todos, notes, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline\n- **Drag & Drop:** @dnd-kit/core 6.3.1\n- **Charts:** Recharts 2.15.4 (forecast, spending breakdown)\n- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub main branch)\n- **Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What Exists (Feb 2026)\n\n### Pages\n| Route | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/today` | Daily unified board — all projects, sprint banner, deadlines sidebar |\n| `/board` | Full board with collapsible project sections |\n| `/projects` | Project grid listing |\n| `/projects/[slug]` | Project detail (List / Board / About tabs) |\n| `/projects/[slug]/notes` | Per-project notes scratchpad (Supabase-backed) |\n| `/projects/[slug]/brain` | Brain file viewer (renders markdown from brain files) |\n| `/cash` | Financial dashboard (balance, forecast, transactions, recurring) |\n| `/goals` | Revenue targets, strategy, 90d/6mo metrics per project |\n| `/log` | Completed items journal (grouped by date) |\n| `/calendar` | Month view with color-coded due dates |\n| `/dreamwatch` | Dream Beds video encode/upload pipeline monitor |\n\n### Features\n- Drag-and-drop kanban (unified + per-project)\n- Sprint banner with countdown + progress bar\n- Deadline tags (only real hard-date items show in sidebar)\n- Focus items float to top of columns\n- Financial sidebar (debts, payments, income under deadlines)\n- Auto-archive completed items (status: 'archived', not deleted)\n- Notes per project (pin, edit inline, delete)\n- Brain file viewer per project (renders markdown brain files in app)\n- External link to Tango Dashboard (tangochilesauce.github.io/tango-dashboard/)\n\n### Sub-Projects\n- Tango → Amazon, Costco, UNFI, DTC\n- Each has its own brain file, notes page, and board\n\n### Stores (Zustand)\n| Store | Tables | Purpose |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| todo-store | todos | Tasks, kanban, focus, deadlines, archiving |\n| note-store | notes | Per-project scratchpad notes |\n| transaction-store | transactions, settings | Income, expenses, balance, forecast |\n| column-store | kanban_columns | Custom kanban columns per project |\n| dreamwatch-store | dreamwatch_pipeline | Video pipeline polling |\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### Done\n- [x] Unified kanban board (Today page)\n- [x] Project detail pages (List/Board/About)\n- [x] Cash Flow page (balance, forecast, transactions, recurring)\n- [x] Calendar page with color dots\n- [x] Dreamwatch video pipeline monitor\n- [x] Goals strategic dashboard (90d/6mo)\n- [x] Completed items log (/log)\n- [x] Sprint banner\n- [x]

orders + drop zone intake on Tango Dashboard)\n- [ ] Rich About/README pages for all projects (only JEFF populated)\n- [ ] Supabase tables for contacts, learnings, intel\n- [ ] Pattern detection and insights\n- [ ] Connect /jeff command to brain files for boot-up\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\n/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/jeff/\n├── brain/                ← Brain files (Claude reads/writes, app

Revenue comes through multiple channels — Amazon (direct), UNFI (distribution to Whole Foods, etc.), EXP Corp, and emerging channels (Costco, DTC, Faire, Mable).\n\nThe business is real and generating ~$6,900/mo but the goal is $50K/mo by Q2 2026. The gap is $43,100/mo.\n\nProduction happens at Foodies (co-packing) with ingredients from Deep. Packaging from Acorn (boxes) and labels. Shipping via Daylight.\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Ship EXP pallet, fix Amazon PPC, close DTC sales\n**12 months:** $30,000/mo across Amazon + UNFI + Costco + DTC\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n- Traffic is the bottleneck on Amazon, not conversion\n- PPC barely running (~$66 over 60 days) — massive untapped lever\n- Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue\n- Mango mystery SOLVED: 14.7% conversion is market-rate\n- UNFI SoPac (LA) is WHERE THE GROWTH IS: +516% YoY\n- UNFI Northeast needs SKU expansion (no Mango)\n- Mango adds ~7 units/week net at Whole Foods\n\n## COGS & Margins\n\n| Flavor | COGS | UNFI Margin | Best Channel |\n|--------|------|-------------|--------------|\n| Sriracha | $2.74 | — | EXP 34%, Amazon 63% |\n| Mango | $3.31 | 31% | Best UNFI margin |\n| Truffle | $3.34 | — | EXP 60%, Amazon 70% |\n| Mild | $3.37 | 30% | Amazon 55% |\n| Thai | $3.42 | — | Amazon 54% |\n| Hot | $3.49 | 28% | Amazon 53% |\n\n## Production Costs (Per Run)\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n| Deep (ingredients) | $1,300 |\n| Foodies (co-pack) | $1,100 |\n| Boxes (Acorn) | $804 |\n| Labels | $1,500 |\n| Shipping (Daylight) | $400 |\n| **Total per run** | **$5,104** |\n\n## Channel Revenue Targets\n\n| Channel | Target | Current | Gap |\n|---------|--------|---------|-----|\n| Amazon | $10,000 | $3,500 | $6,500 |\n| UNFI | $10,000 | $3,400 | $6,600 |\n| Costco | $5,000 | $0 | $5,000 |\n| DTC | — | $0 | — |\n\n## Orders System (NEXT BUILD)\n\n**Goal:** Full order lifecycle management on Tango Dashboard\n\n### What We Need\n1. **Supabase `orders` table** — id, channel, po_number, value, date, stage (new/processing/shipped/paid), doc paths (po_url, bol_url, inv_url), notes, created_at, updated_at\n2. **Migrate dashboard from localStorage → Supabase** — same pipeline UI, persistent data\n3. **Drop zone for new POs** — drag a PDF onto a box on the dashboard, it:\n   - Scans/parses the document for PO number, channel, value\n   - Creates a folder in `/Projects/🔥 tango/orders-invoices/{channel}/{po-number}/`\n   - Moves the file into that folder\n   - Creates a new order card in the \"New\" column\n4. **Document export links** — PO, BOL, Invoice buttons on each card link to the actual files\n5. **Existing folder:** `/Projects/🔥 tango/orders-invoices/` already has channel subfolders (Amazon, Costco, DTC, EXP, Faire, Mable, UNFI)\n\n### Architecture Decision\n- Order DATA → Supabase (stage, value, dates, doc URLs)\n- Order FILES → Local folders (PDFs stay on machine, organized by channel/PO)\n- Tango Dashboard reads from Supabase, displays pipeline, handles drag-and-drop\n- Drop zone intake: browser-side file handling → parse → create folder → insert row\n\n## Files\n\n*Scanned Feb 16, 2026 from /Projects/🔥 tango/ (symlinked at /⚡ claudio/tango/)*\n\n| Folder | Files | What's In There |\n|--------|-------|-----------------|\n| amazon/ | 1,776 | Listings, A+ content, flat files, FNSKU labels, PPC data, screenshots |\n| brand/ | 2,834 | Labels, logos, nutrition facts, UPCs, 2026 brand system, rebrand assets |\n| business/ | 421 | Legal, FDA, insurance, certificates, BOL, food safety, CA compliance |\n| production/ | 1,201 | Kitchen photos, packaging suppliers, purchase orders, billing, label proofs |\n| distribution/ | 563 | UNFI docs, Costco materials, Faire, old retailers |\n| images/ | 2,882 | Product photography (new label, old label) |\n| sales/ | 264 | Decks, data exports, one-sheets |\n| marketing/ | 804 | Ads, collabs, events |\n| media/ | 1,086 | Video, audio, press, Pixar intro, No More Clog |\n| website/ | 1,847 | Old web builds, 2026-02-12 website data |\n| tangofest/ | 1,586 | The big summer event |\n| backburner products/ | 273 | Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk |\n| orders-invoices/ | 23 | By channel: Amazon, Costco, DTC, EXP, Faire, Mable, UNFI |\n| merch/ | 55 | Hats, shirts, stickers, Tango Flame beanie |\n| social/ | 18 | Social media content (dated post folders) |\n| misc/ | 119 | Claude docs, inspiration, misc |\n| current bills/ | 3 | Active invoices/screenshots |\n| tango dashboard/ | 2 | Dashboard icon assets |\n",

    "content": "# Tango DTC — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales are currently $0. This is an untapped channel with real potential — we have an email list in Klaviyo, a Shopify store, and a domain that just need to be cleaned up and activated.\n\n**The Email Situation:** Dan previously used Klaviyo for email marketing, but deliverability tanked badly — most subscribers weren't seeing emails. Cancelled Klaviyo due to cost vs poor open rates. DNS was updated at that time but hasn't been checked in months. List is still in Klaviyo (account may be downgraded, not closed — need to verify).\n\n**Domain:** tangochilesauce.com. Email handled by IONOS. Shopify store exists.\n\n**14-Day Sprint Plan (Feb 14-28):** Clean DNS → export list → warm up with Shopify Email → drive first DTC sales.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- Klaviyo deliverability was destroyed — domain had stale Klaviyo DNS records left behind\n- **DNS audit (Feb 17, 2026):** DMARC is solid (p=quarantine, 100%, reports to postmaster@). SPF has STALE Klaviyo + SendGrid includes. DKIM has two stale Klaviyo signing keys still live. MX records are clean (IONOS).\n- Domain DNS was \"updated\" when Klaviyo cancelled but Klaviyo ghosts were left in — `include:klaviyo-mail.com` and `include:sendgrid.net` still in SPF, `kl._domainkey` and `kl2._domainkey` DKIM records still active\n- Email list is dormant — needs tiered re-engagement, NOT a blast to everyone\n- **Shopify Email is the play** — 10K free emails/mo, no branding, native Shopify integration, zero extra cost. Beats MailerLite (500 contact cap), Brevo (300/day limit), Mailchimp (250 contacts lol)\n- Klaviyo data retention: if account was downgraded (not fully closed), all data is still there. If fully closed, data is permanently deleted\n- Re-engagement math: expect 5-15% of dormant list to re-engage, 1-2% conversion on openers\n- First email should NOT be a sale — \"we're back\" personal note to generate positive signals\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n- Klaviyo for email marketing — cancelled due to poor deliverability + high cost (date unknown, months ago)\n- Updated domain DNS settings when Klaviyo was cancelled — but left stale Klaviyo records behind\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- ~~What domain is sending from?~~ **ANSWERED: tangochilesauce.com, IONOS mail**\n- ~~What's the current SPF/DKIM/DMARC status?~~ **ANSWERED: DMARC good, SPF/DKIM have stale Klaviyo refs**\n- ~~Is the Shopify store set up?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, exists**\n- ~~What email platform to use?~~ **ANSWERED: Shopify Email (10K free, native, no branding)**\n- What's the current email list size? How old is it? When was the last send?\n- Can Dan still log into Klaviyo to export the list?\n- Is anyone monitoring postmaster@tangochilesauce.com for DMARC reports?\n- DTC pricing strategy — same as Amazon? Higher? Bundle deals?\n- Social media following / other traffic sources to pair with email?\n\n## Short-Term Goal\n\n**This month (Feb 2026):** Clean DNS → export list from Klaviyo → warm up via Shopify Email → drive first direct sales\n\n## Long-Term Goal\n\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo DTC revenue stream\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] **Log into Klaviyo** — export full subscriber list as CSV (if account still accessible)\n- [ ] **Clean DNS in IONOS** — remove klaviyo-mail.com from SPF, remove sendgrid.net from SPF, delete kl._domainkey CNAME, delete kl2._domainkey CNAME\n- [ ] **Run domain health checks** — MXToolbox.com blacklist check, Sender Score, Google Postmaster Tools\n- [ ] **Verify exported list** — run through NeverBounce/ZeroBounce free tier, kill dead emails\n- [ ] **Set up Shopify Email** — Marketing section in Shopify admin, add Shopify SPF/DKIM to DNS\n- [ ] **Segment list into tiers** — Tier 1 (50-100 known/recent), Tier 2 (100-200 moderate), Tier 3 (rest)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 1** — \"We're Back\" personal note from Dan, no sale\n- [ ] **Send Tier 1** — monitor opens/bounces/complaints for 24hr\n- [ ] **Send Tier 2** — if Tier 1 clean\n- [ ] **Send Tier 3** — if Tier 2 clean\n- [ ] **Draft Email 2** — value content (recipe, brand story, behind the scenes)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 3** — THE OFFER (discount code / bundle / free shipping)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 4** — \"Last chance\" urgency\n- [ ] Redesign Tango website/Shopify store for DTC sales\n- [ ] Set up DTC pricing / promotions / bundles\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n- [x] DNS audit — completed Feb 17, found stale Klaviyo records\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Domain DNS audit (Feb 17) — identified stale SPF includes + DKIM keys\n- [x] Platform research — Shopify Email selected (10K free, native, no branding)\n- [x] Re-engagement strategy designed — 4-email tiered warmup over 14 days\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n**Email Platform Free Tiers (Feb 2026):**\n| Platform | Free Emails/mo | Free Contacts | Branding? | Winner? |\n|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|---------|\n| Shopify Email | 10,000 | Unlimited | No watermark | ✅ YES |\n| MailerLite | 12,000 | 500 | Yes | Too small |\n| Brevo | ~9,000 (300/day) | 100,000 | Yes | Backup option |\n| Mailchimp | 500 | 250 | Yes | Avoid |\n| Klaviyo Free | 500 | 250 | Yes | Too small |\n\n**DNS Records to Clean (IONOS panel):**\n| Action | Record | What to Remove |\n|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:klaviyo-mail.com` |\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:sendgrid.net` (if no active SendGrid use) |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl._domainkey | Points to kl.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl2._domainkey | Points to kl2.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n\n**Re-Engagement Timeline:**\n- Email 1 (Day 3): \"We're back\" — personal, no sale\n- Email 2 (Day 6-7): Value content — recipe/story\n- Email 3 (Day 10): THE OFFER — discount/bundle\n- Email 4 (Day 12-14): \"Last chance\" urgency\n\n**Expected Results (1,000 person list):**\n- ~150 re-engage (15%)\n- ~10 buy (7% of engaged)\n- ~$250 revenue from sprint\n- Real value: clean engaged list for long-term DTC channel\n\n## Files\n\n*Shopify store: [need URL]*\n*Klaviyo account: [need to check if accessible]*\n*Located at: /Projects/🔥 tango/website/ (if exists)*\n",
