    "content": "# JEFF State — Last Updated Feb 17, 2026 (Session 3)\n\nThis is the boot-up file. Read this first every session.\n\n## What Happened This Session\n\n### Big Wins\n- **Brain page built** — Every project now has a Brain tab that renders the actual brain markdown files in the JEFF app. Nothing hidden from Dan anymore.\n- **Brain build pipeline** — `scripts/build-brain.mjs` reads all brain files at build time, writes to `src/data/brain.ts`. Runs automatically via `prebuild` hook on every Vercel deploy.\n- **Compact text rendering** — Brain pages use tiny text (11px body, 10px tables) so you can see maximum content per screen.\n- **DTC email recovery plan** — Full research done: DNS audit, platform comparison, 4-email tiered re-engagement strategy, 14-day sprint timeline.\n- **All brain files updated** — Every active project now has a rich, comprehensive brain file with strategy, learnings, metrics, pipelines, and intel.\n- **13 DTC todos added** — Full email recovery pipeline in Supabase under tango-dtc.\n- **Dan refactored project detail page** — Brain and Notes are now inline tabs on the project page (not separate routes). Smart move.\n\n### Previous Session (Feb 17, Session 2)\n- Vercel deployed — JEFF live at assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n- Tango Dashboard deployed (GitHub Pages)\n- Orders pipeline built on Tango Dashboard\n- Notes system built (Supabase + Zustand + UI)\n- UNFI sub-project added\n- Waiting column removed, sidebar scroll fixed\n- FFEEDD brand messaging captured\n\n### Previous Session (Feb 16-17, Session 1)\n- Imported 34 schedule items into Supabase\n- Built deadline tag system\n- Added Goals dashboard, Completed log, financial sidebar, sprint banner\n- Square apple-icon for iPhone\n\n## Current Pipeline Snapshot\n\n### ✅ Done (This Session)\n- Brain page built (per-project, renders markdown)\n- Brain build pipeline (prebuild → brain.ts)\n- Compact text rendering\n- DTC email recovery research + plan\n- All brain files updated to full depth\n- 13 DTC email pipeline todos added to Supabase\n- DTC brain: DNS audit, Shopify Email selected, 4-email strategy designed\n- JEFF brain: corrected from \"GitHub Pages\" to Vercel, full architecture documented\n\n### 📋 To Do (Next Priority)\n- **DTC Sprint (URGENT):**\n  - Log into Klaviyo → export list\n  - Clean DNS in IONOS (remove stale Klaviyo SPF/DKIM)\n  - Set up Shopify Email\n  - Send first re-engagement email\n- **Amazon:** Restart PPC ($10-20/day on Truffle)\n- **Madder:** Single drops 2/22 (5 days away)\n- **Costco:** Call Moses T-F this week\n- **UNFI:** Follow up John Lawson, Endless Aisle paperwork\n- **Orders system v2:** Supabase-backed orders + drop zone intake\n- **Dream Beds:** Batch video sessions\n\n## Active Projects\n\n| Project | Weight | Status | Current Goal |\n|---------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| 🔥 Tango | 65% | Active | Ship EXP pallet, fix Amazon PPC, close DTC sales |\n| 🔥 → Amazon | 25% | Active | Restart PPC, optimize Truffle listing |\n| 🔥 → Costco | 15% | Active | Close roadshow deal with Moses |\n| 🔥 → UNFI | 25% | Active | SKU expansion into Northeast, complete Endless Aisle |\n| 🔥 → DTC | 5% | **SPRINT** | Clean DNS → export list → warm up → drive sales |\n| 📱 FFEEDD | 15% | Launched | Get first 15 paid downloads |\n| 🤖 JEFF | 10% | Building | Brain page live, all files visible to Dan |\n| 🎸 Madder | 5% | Active | Drop single 2/22, build pre-save to 50+ |\n| 🎬 Dream Beds | 5% | Active | Upload 28 videos, hit 100 subs |\n| 🏠 Life Admin | 0% | Always | Pay all bills on time |\n\n## 14-Day Sprint (Feb 14-28)\n**Goal:** Ship pallet · Restart PPC · Drop single · Launch FFEEDD · DTC email push\n**Target:** $5,000 new revenue\n**Day:** 4 of 14\n\n## Key Blockers\n\n- **DTC:** Need to log into Klaviyo to confirm list is accessible (if account was fully closed, list is gone)\n- **DTC:** Stale Klaviyo DNS records need cleaning in IONOS before any sends\n- **UNFI:** John Lawson response needed for NE SKU expansion\n- **UNFI:** Endless Aisle paperwork incomplete\n- **Amazon:** PPC barely running (~$66/60d) — massive untapped lever\n- **Cash:** Balance ~$45, tight until UNFI MOR (~Feb 23) and EXP invoice (~Mar 21)\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Channel | Role | Status |\n|------|---------|------|--------|\n| Moses Romero | Costco | Asst Buyer, D13 | Roadshows discussion, call T-F |\n| John Lawson | UNFI/WF | Whole Foods buyer | Follow up needed |\n| Brittney Langlois | UNFI | UpNext SDM | Monthly check-ins |\n| Lauren Martinez | Erewhon | Brand Management | Warm lead from 2022 |\n\n## Financial Snapshot\n\n- Balance: ~$45\n- Monthly in: ~$12,144 (Amazon $1,900 + UNFI SoPac $3,422 + UNFI NE $3,422 + EXP $3,400)\n- Monthly out: ~$4,037+ (Rent $2,878 + Insurance $376 + Storage $350 + Studio $300 + Claude $100 + PPC $33)\n- Net: positive but tight — timing matters\n\n## System Architecture\n\n- **JEFF app:** /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/jeff/ (Next.js 16, Vercel)\n- **JEFF live:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app (auto-deploys from GitHub main)\n- **Tango Dashboard:** tangochilesauce.github.io/tango-dashboard/ (GitHub Pages)\n- **Brain files:** /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/jeff/brain/ → built to src/data/brain.ts on deploy\n- **Supabase:** muowpjabnjkqgwgzfmoj.supabase.co (tables: todos, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline, notes)\n- **GitHub repos:** tangochilesauce/assistant (JEFF), tangochilesauce/tango-dashboard\n",

    "content": "# Dream Beds — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDream Beds is a YouTube channel about bed reviews/content. Goal is consistent daily uploads to build the channel. Has a custom video pipeline system (**Dreamwatch**) that syncs local queue state to Supabase for real-time monitoring in JEFF.\n\nThe channel is in growth mode — volume of uploads matters more than polish right now. Batch production sessions maximize output per day.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Batch production is the play** — record multiple videos in one session, then process/upload over time\n- **Dreamwatch pipeline works** — automated encode → upload → publish workflow monitored in JEFF\n- **Queue path uses underscore**: `_ queue/` (not `! queue` — this was a bug that was fixed Feb 2026)\n- **Shorts + cross-posting** doubles distribution without extra recording time\n- **Consistency beats quality** at this stage — need 100 subs to unlock monetization features\n\n## System Architecture\n\n- **Queue path:** `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/_ queue/`\n- **Sync daemon:** `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/scripts/dreamwatch_sync.py`\n- **Dreamwatch page in JEFF:** `/dreamwatch` — real-time pipeline status (polls Supabase every 5s)\n- **Supabase table:** `dreamwatch_pipeline` — tracks encode progress, upload status, YouTube URLs\n- **Pipeline states:** STEP0_META → STEP1 → ... → PUBLISHED\n- **Card statuses:** ACTIVE, QUEUED, PUBLISHED, FAILED, UNPAIRED_VIDEO, UNPAIRED_THUMB\n\n### How It Works\n1. Drop video + thumbnail into `_ queue/` folder\n2. Dreamwatch daemon detects new files, starts encoding\n3. Progress syncs to Supabase in real-time\n4. JEFF's Dreamwatch page shows live encode %, upload %, ETA\n5. Video publishes to YouTube, URL captured in Supabase\n\n## Strategy\n\n1. **Batch 7 videos per session** — maximize studio time\n2. **Cut Shorts from long-form** — 5 Shorts per batch\n3. **Cross-post to TikTok + Reels** — same content, 3x distribution\n4. **Hit 100 subs** — unlock community posts, stories, channel customization\n5. **28 videos in February** — daily upload cadence\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What's the current subscriber count?\n- How many videos uploaded so far?\n- What's the average view count per video?\n- Which video topics/types perform best?\n- Any revenue from existing videos?\n- Is the dreamwatch_sync.py daemon running reliably?\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Upload 28 videos, hit 100 subscribers\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo (ad revenue + sponsorships + affiliate links)\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] Batch 7 videos (next session)\n- [ ] Cut 5 Shorts from existing long-form\n- [ ] Cross-post to TikTok + Reels\n- [ ] Batch another 7 videos (second session)\n- [ ] Review analytics — what's working, what's not\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n(depends on current session status)\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Dreamwatch pipeline built and deployed\n- [x] Queue path fixed (`_ queue/` not `! queue`)\n- [x] Dreamwatch page live in JEFF\n\n## Files\n\n*Located at: /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/*\n- scripts/ — automation scripts (dreamwatch_sync.py)\n- _ queue/ — upload workflow queue\n",

    "content": "# FFEEDD — Brain\n\n**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month\n**Weight:** 15%\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\nFFEEDD is a minimalist iOS journal app with a retro terminal/CRT aesthetic. Green-on-black, JetBrainsMono font, blinking block cursor, double-newline to submit. Dark mode only. \"Write like it's 1985.\"\n\n**Status:** LAUNCHING. App is built. Monetization decided.\n\n**Monetization (DECIDED Feb 14):** $10 upfront — premium positioning, exclusivity play. The Supreme model: the price IS the product. One cool girl has it → everyone wants it. Test at $10 for 30 days. If it doesn't move, drop to $1 as \"80% off\" which creates urgency + press hook. After 60 days → $1/month subscription via StoreKit.\n\n- After Apple's 30% cut: **$7/download**\n- 15 downloads = $105 (week 1 target)\n- 72 downloads = $504 (month target)\n- At $1/mo sub: need 5,000 subscribers for $5K/mo\n\n**NO BLOCKER. SHIPPING.**\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | LAUNCH. Get on the App Store. First 15 paid downloads. |\n| **12 Months** | $5K/month from subscriptions (~5,000 active subscribers) |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Downloads | 0 | 10,000 | +10,000 |\n| Conversion rate | 0% | 5-10% | — |\n| Paid subscribers | 0 | 5,000 | +5,000 |\n\n### Post-Launch Targets\n\n| Metric | Week 1 | Month 1 |\n|--------|--------|---------|\n| Downloads | 1,000 | 5,000 |\n| DAU | 200 | 1,000 |\n| Reviews | 25 | 100+ |\n| Rating | 4.5+ | 4.5+ |\n\n---\n\n## Launch Checklist\n\n### COMPOSE PAGE\n- [ ] Checkbox line spacing (8pt between consecutive checkboxes)\n- [ ] Long press checkbox insert (0.2s)\n- [ ] Checkbox auto-continue on enter\n- [ ] Empty checkbox deletion on enter\n- [ ] Double-return to save\n- [ ] Cursor positioning after checkbox insert\n\n### FEED PAGE\n- [ ] Checkbox toggle from feed (tap toggles [x]/[ ])\n- [ ] Strikethrough on checked items\n- [ ] Pin swipe (right swipe only, no double-slide)\n- [ ] Entry expand/collapse animation (date slides down)\n- [ ] Entry row tap vs checkbox tap priority\n\n### SETTINGS PANEL\n- [ ] Sidebar layout (fixed heights, no stretching)\n- [ ] About content display\n- [ ] Support/Privacy/Rate links\n- [ ] Backup functionality\n- [ ] Stats display\n- [ ] Reset confirmation\n\n### EDITOR PAGE\n- [ ] Checkbox editing in existing entries\n- [ ] Checkbox line spacing matching compose\n- [ ] Back button dismiss\n- [ ] Save on double-return\n\n### APP-WIDE\n- [ ] First-run warmup (no stutter)\n- [ ] Splash screen timing\n- [ ] Transitions smooth\n- [ ] Haptics calibrated\n- [ ] Memory/performance\n\n### APP STORE SUBMISSION\n- [ ] Apple Developer account active ($99/year)\n- [ ] App icon (1024x1024)\n- [ ] Screenshots (6.7\", 6.5\", 5.5\" iPhone)\n- [ ] App name: \"FFEEDD\"\n- [ ] Subtitle (30 chars max)\n- [ ] Description (4000 chars max)\n- [ ] Keywords (100 chars max)\n- [ ] Privacy Policy URL\n- [ ] Support URL\n- [ ] App category (Lifestyle primary, Productivity secondary)\n- [ ] Age rating questionnaire\n- [ ] StoreKit subscription setup ($1/month)\n- [ ] In-app purchase review info\n- [ ] Build uploaded via Xcode/Transporter\n- [ ] Export compliance (encryption questionnaire)\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n### Confirmed\n- **Core app works** — SwiftUI + SwiftData, terminal aesthetic is polished\n- **UI concept is differentiated** — Most journal apps are soft/feminine. This is stark, focused, minimal.\n- **The aesthetic resonates** — Terminal/retro computing has a niche but passionate audience\n- **CaretlessTextView architecture** — Hide native caret via `tintColor = .clear`, NOT by overriding `caretRect()` (that breaks custom cursor positioning)\n- **Checkbox format needs space inside** — `[ ] ` not `[] ` — cursor lands after the space for immediate typing\n- **highPriorityGesture** — Use this in SwiftUI to make child taps override parent taps (checkbox vs entry expand)\n- **Keyboard dismiss timing** — Must call `resignFirstResponder` BEFORE transition animation starts\n- **Monetization DECIDED Feb 14, 2026** — $10 upfront launch (30-day test). Supreme pricing model — exclusivity IS the product. Can always drop to $1 but can never go up.\n- **Day One pricing: $49.99/year** ($4.17/mo) — industry benchmark. Has free tier + premium (validates freemium). Annual only, no monthly.\n- **2026 app pricing trend**: Subscriptions > one-time for retention + recurring revenue\n\n### Pricing Evolution\n1. Initially undecided (subscription vs one-time vs freemium)\n2. Considered $4.99/mo or $29.99/year freemium\n3. Decided $1 upfront + 60-day grace + $1/mo subscription\n4. **Final (Feb 14):** $10 upfront (Supreme model), test 30 days, fallback to $1 \"80% off\"\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Softer haptics (.soft, 0.5 intensity) | Feels better | Light haptics were too aggressive |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Doubled fade transitions (not tripled) | Better pacing | 0.6s compose, 0.6s edit, 1.0s feed, 2.0s splash |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Fixed cursor stuck top-left on edit | Works | CaretlessTextView can't override caretRect() to return .zero |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Added fade-to-black before opening posts | Smoother | 0.15s fade overlay before transition |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Fixed spam-enter race condition | No more duplicates | Added isSaving flag guard |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Rebuilt compose screen (CaretlessTextView) | Clean architecture | Unified with editor, removed 400pt inset hack |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Minimal ComposeActionBar (just cancel) | Cleaner UI | Matches editor's back button style |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Long press (0.2s) inserts checkbox | Works great | Inserts on new line with `[ ] ` format |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Checkbox auto-continue on enter | Works | Enter after checkbox line creates new checkbox |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Empty checkbox deletion on enter | Works | Removes empty checkbox, allows double-return to save |\n| Jan 26, 2026 | Checkbox toggle from feed | Works | Tap checkbox area toggles, strikethrough on checked |\n\n---\n\n## Product Details\n\n**Core Concept:**\n- Green-on-black terminal style\n- JetBrainsMono font\n- Blinking block cursor as primary UI affordance\n- Double-newline to submit entries (like a terminal)\n- Dark mode only\n- **To-do list support:** Long press inserts checkbox, enter auto-continues, tap in feed to toggle\n\n**Tech Stack:** SwiftUI + SwiftData, UIKit integration for text input\n\n**Architecture:**\n- **CaretlessTextView** (shared) — custom UITextView with hidden caret via `tintColor = .clear`\n- Block cursor via UILabel positioned at caretRect()\n- ComposeActionBar / EditorActionBar — minimal action bars\n- **highPriorityGesture** — SwiftUI child taps override parent taps\n- **Keyboard dismiss** — `resignFirstResponder` BEFORE transition animation\n\n**Potential Pro Features (post-launch):**\n- Unlimited entries (free tier: X entries/month?)\n- Export (markdown, txt)\n- iCloud sync\n- Additional themes (amber, blue, white-on-black)\n- Widgets\n- Streaks/statistics\n\n---\n\n## App Store Optimization\n\n**Keywords (100 chars):**\n```\njournal,diary,retro,terminal,minimalist,dark mode,CRT,vintage,aesthetic,writing,notes,hacker,green\n```\n\n**Category:** Lifestyle (Primary), Productivity (Secondary)\n\n**App Store Description:**\n```\nWrite like it's 1985.\n\nFFEEDD is a journaling app for people who love the glow of a CRT monitor\nand the simplicity of a blinking cursor. No distractions. No cloud sync.\nNo social features. Just you, your thoughts, and a terminal.\n\nStart writing. The cursor is waiting.\n```\n\n**Screenshot Frame Captions:**\n1. \"Write like it's 1985\"\n2. \"Just you and the cursor\"\n3. \"Color code your thoughts\"\n4. \"Zero distractions\"\n\n**Visual Assets Needed:**\n- App Icon (1024x1024)\n- Screenshots (iPhone 6.7\", 6.5\", 5.5\") — 4-8 per size\n- App Preview Video (15-30 seconds)\n\n---\n\n## Launch Plan\n\n### Pre-Launch: Beta Testing via TestFlight\n**Goal:** 50-100 beta testers before launch\n**Where to recruit:**\n- r/journaling, r/TestFlight, r/retrobattlestations\n- Twitter with #buildinpublic\n\n### Launch Day Checklist\n- [ ] Verify app is live on App Store\n- [ ] Post to Product Hunt (12:01 AM PT)\n- [ ] Show HN post on Hacker News\n- [ ] Tweet announcement on all platforms\n- [ ] Email beta testers: \"We're live!

No account. No distractions.\nJust you, your thoughts, and a blinking cursor.\n\nDownload on iOS: [link]\n```\n\n### Key Success Factors\n1. **Nail the aesthetic** in all marketing\n2. **Target the niche** — Retro enthusiasts > general population\n3. **Build in public** — Share the journey\n4. **Reviews early** — 25+ reviews in first 48 hours\n5. **Respond to everything** — Early users become evangelists\n\n---\n\n## Growth Plan\n\n### The Funnel Math (to $5K MRR at $1/mo)\n\n| Stage | Metric | Number Needed |\n|-------|--------|---------------|\n| **Paying subscribers** | Target | 5,000 |\n| **Free users** | @ 5% conversion | 100,000 |\n| **Downloads** | @ 50% activation | 200,000 |\n| **App Store views** | @ 30% download rate | 670,000 |\n\n**Key insight:** Conversion rate is the highest-leverage variable. 5% → 10% cuts required downloads in half.\n\n### Paywall Strategy (Feature-Gated)\n\n**Free tier:**\n- 10 entries/month\n- 1 color (green only)\n- Basic functionality\n\n**$1/month Premium:**\n- Unlimited entries\n- All 6 colors\n- Future features (themes, export, widgets, sync)\n\n### Growth Levers (Ranked)\n\n1. **ASO** — 65-70% of app discovery is App Store search. Free traffic. Expected: 500-2,000 organic downloads/month.\n2. **Viral/Referral** — \"Give a friend 1 month free / Get 1 month free.\" Share entry as image with FFEEDD branding. Expected: 0.2-0.5 viral coefficient.\n3. **Content Marketing** — Blog on ffeedd.us (SEO). Reddit (r/journaling = 1.4M members). TikTok (aesthetic content).\n4. **Paid Acquisition** — With $1/mo LTV of ~$6, need CAC under $2. Very difficult. Use sparingly.\n\n### Retention (Everything at $1/mo)\n\n| Monthly Churn | Users After 12 Months (per 1K starting) |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 10% | 282 |\n| 5% | 540 |\n| 3% | 694 |\n| 2% | 785 |\n\n**Retention tactics:**\n1. Onboarding: First 7 days determine everything\n2. Notifications: \"The cursor is waiting\" (on-brand)\n3. Streaks: Don't break the chain psychology\n4. Regular updates: New themes quarterly\n\n### Phased Growth\n\n| Phase | Months | Goal | Success Metric |\n|-------|--------|------|----------------|\n| Foundation | 1-2 | Launch with subscription | 500 downloads |\n| Validate | 3-4 | Prove unit economics | 500 subscribers, 5%+ conversion |\n| Scale | 5-8 | Reach 2,500 subscribers | Sustainable growth rate |\n| Optimize | 9-12 | Hit $5K MRR | 5,000 subscribers |\n\n### What to Build First (Before Launch)\n\n**P0 (Must Have):**\n1. StoreKit 2 integration\n2. Paywall screen\n3. Entitlement checking\n4. Restore purchases\n5. Free tier limits\n\n**P1 (Should Have):**\n1. Onboarding flow\n2. Analytics\n3. Push notifications\n4. Settings screen\n\n---\n\n## Marketing Ideas\n\n- **Product Hunt** — Terminal aesthetic will stand out\n- **r/terminal, r/unixporn, r/mechanicalkeyboards** — The aesthetic audience\n- **Developer Twitter** — Developers love terminal aesthetics\n- **TikTok** — ASMR-ish typing videos with the green cursor\n- **Hacker News** — If framed as a thoughtful, minimal tool\n- **Influencer Outreach:** Retro tech YouTubers (LGR, Techmoan, 8-Bit Guy), Productivity YouTubers (Ali Abdaal, Thomas Frank), iOS reviewers (Christopher Lawley), Journaling influencers\n\n---\n\n## Brand / Messaging\n\n- **Core tagline:** \"Write like it's 1985\" / \"Quiet personal thoughts\"\n- **Positioning:** Private journaling, no social features, no sharing, no followers. Just you and your thoughts.\n- **Tone:** Calm, understated, intimate. The anti-social-media journal.\n- **Domain:** ffeedd.us (GoDaddy — dan@frieber.com)\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- ~~Subscription vs. one-time vs. freemium?~~ **DECIDED: $10 upfront (30-day test) → $1/mo sub after 60 days**\n- What's the launch strategy — soft launch or Product Hunt splash?\n- Who's the target user?

    "content": "# JEFF — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nJEFF is the operating system for everything Dan builds. It's a Next.js web app deployed on **Vercel** (auto-deploys on every push to main), backed by **Supabase** for all persistent data. Plus a Claude Code slash command (/jeff) for conversational daily planning.\n\nThe philosophy: no scoring math, no rigid ranked lists. Show Dan the state of everything, let him pick. Priority is a story, not a formula.\n\n**Live URL:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n**Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Vercel > GitHub Pages for Next.js** — switched mid-session Feb 17. No more localhost crashes. Auto-deploys every push.\n- **Localhost dev server is unreliable** — crashes constantly, needs `lsof -i :3000 | xargs kill -9` to recover. Vercel made this irrelevant.\n- **Static export (`output: \"export\"`) works fine with Supabase** — all data is client-side fetched. No SSR needed for this use case.\n- **Supabase tables need manual SQL creation** — can't create via REST API with anon key. Run SQL in Supabase dashboard.\n- **Brain files are the soul of the system** — Claude reads/writes them between sessions, but Dan couldn't see them until the Brain page was built.\n- **Tags system is powerful** — JSONB tags on todos handle: focus, deadline, completed:DATE, archived. Flexible metadata without schema changes.\n- **dnd-kit closestCenter > closestCorners** — less finicky for 3-column layouts.\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Build JEFF into a usable daily tool — fully operational command center\n**12 months:** Replace Notion entirely as the single source of truth\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4\n- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Lucide icons, Geist font\n- **State:** Zustand 5.0.11 (5 stores: todos, notes, transactions, columns, dreamwatch)\n- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — 6 tables: todos, notes, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline\n- **Drag & Drop:** @dnd-kit/core 6.3.1\n- **Charts:** Recharts 2.15.4 (forecast, spending breakdown)\n- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub main branch)\n- **Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What Exists (Feb 2026)\n\n### Pages\n| Route | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/today` | Daily unified board — all

    "content": "# Tango Chile Sauce — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nTango is a premium hot sauce brand with 6 flavors: Sriracha, Mango, Truffle, Mild, Thai, Hot. Revenue comes through multiple channels — Amazon (direct), UNFI (distribution to Whole Foods, etc.), EXP Corp, and emerging channels (Costco, DTC, Faire, Mable).\n\nThe business is real and generating ~$6,900/mo but the goal is $50K/mo by Q2 2026. The gap is $43,100/mo.\n\nProduction happens at Foodies (co-packing) with ingredients from Deep. Packaging from Acorn (boxes) and labels. Shipping via Daylight.\n\n**Channel vs Key Account distinction:** A \"Channel\" means you invoice them directly (Amazon, UNFI, Costco, EXP, Faire, Mable). A \"Key Account\" means they order through a distributor (e.g., Whole Foods orders via UNFI).\n\n---\n\n## Brand Identity\n\n**Name**: Tango Chile Sauce, LLC\n**Tagline**: Born in NYC, Made in LA\n**Established**: April 29, 2013\n**Federal EIN**: 46-2641462\n**FDA Number**: 11095246958\n**GS1 Account**: 30042269\n\n## The Origin Story\n\nWhen grandma first crafted her legendary chile in 1940s Honduras, she started with seven simple ingredients — most growing right outside her home. It started in her youth with a wild Scotch Bonnet plant that produced peppers every season.\n\nIt stayed small and honest at first — just family, neighbors, and friends. Then she started bottling it for the local market, where it took off. For a few bright years it lived out in the world, until she came to America and the recipe went quiet.\n\nIn 2015, she showed Dan her chile for the first time and it was over. He became obsessed. She showed him how to make it and he started making it naturally for himself, then for friends, then for stores, and Tango was born.\n\n## Brand Voice\n\n**Personality:** Approachable but premium. Health-conscious without being preachy. Bold, flavorful, fun.\n**Tone:** Confident, not arrogant. Playful when appropriate. Honest about ingredients and process.\n**Words We Use:** Clean, whole food, carrot-based, Keto-friendly, no sugar added, small batch, craft, artisan\n**Words We Avoid:** Cheap, budget, discount, diet, low-cal, \"Just like TRUFF\"\n\n## Key Messages\n\n**Primary:** Truffle Tango delivers gourmet truffle flavor with clean, healthy ingredients — carrot-based, Keto-friendly, no sugar added.\n**Elevator Pitch:** \"Tango is the healthy truffle hot sauce. We use carrots instead of agave for natural sweetness, making us truly Keto-friendly. You get 8oz of gourmet truffle flavor at a better price than the big guys, and the NY Post named us one of the 14 best hot sauces.\"\n\n## Key Selling Points\n\nCarrot-Based, Vegan, No Preservatives, No Sugar, No Gums, Plant-Based, Organic Ingredients, 100% Clean Ingredients, Handmade in Small Batches in CA, Grandma's Recipe, Born in Brooklyn, Gluten-Free, American Made, Family-Owned, Good on Everything, 98%+ sell-through rate, Cold-fill certified (shelf-stable in squeeze bottle without preservatives)\n\n---\n\n## Product Reference\n\n### Core Lineup (8 oz bottles)\n| Flavor | Heat | Cap Color |\n|--------|------|-----------|\n| Truffle Tango | Medium | Black |\n| Hot Tango | Hot | Red |\n| Mild Tango | Mild | Green |\n| Mango Tango | Mild | Yellow |\n| Thai Tango | Medium-Hot | Purple |\n| Sriracha Tango | Hot | Blue |\n\n### Ingredients by Flavor\n- **Hot**: Carrots, Garlic, Limes, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, Sawtooth Cilantro, Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt\n- **Mild**: Carrots, Garlic, Limes, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, Sawtooth Cilantro, Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt\n- **Truffle**: Carrots, Garlic, Limes, Chile Peppers, Sawtooth Cilantro, Truffle Flavoring, Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt\n- **Mango**: Mangos, Carrots, Garlic, Limes, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, Sawtooth Cilantro, Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt, Agave Nectar\n- **Thai**: Carrots, Garlic, Limes, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet, Thai Chilies, Sawtooth Cilantro, Cider Vinegar, Sea Salt\n- **Sriracha**: Red Jalapeno, Garlic, White Vinegar, Cane Sugar, Sea Salt\n\n### UPCs — Singles (8oz)\n| Product | UPC |\n|---------|-----|\n| Hot | 196852546671 |\n| Mild | 196852812899 |\n| Truffle | 871661003842 |\n| Mango | 195893424436 |\n| Thai | 195893449477 |\n| Sriracha | 198168929643 |\n\n### UPCs — 6-Packs (Case UPCs for UNFI)\n| Product | Case UPC |\n|---------|----------|\n| Hot 6-Pack | 195893456864 |\n| Mild 6-Pack | 195893300969 |\n| Truffle 6-Pack | 195893555284 |\n| Mango 6-Pack | 196852060641 |\n| Thai 6-Pack | 196852257539 |\n| Sriracha 6-Pack | **NOT REGISTERED** |\n\n### UPCs — 2-Packs\n| Product | UPC |\n|---------|-----|\n| Hot 2-Pack | 198168271391 |\n| Mild 2-Pack | 198168148358 |\n| Truffle 2-Pack | 198168989760 |\n| Mango 2-Pack | 198168818275 |\n| Thai 2-Pack | 198168289372 |\n| Sriracha 2-Pack | 199284382176 |\n\n### Amazon ASINs\n| Product | ASIN |\n|---------|------|\n| Mild Single | B07WW1NFH9 |\n| Hot Single | B07VXY26C6 |\n| Truffle Single | B07WWYQ44K |\n| Thai Single | B09NQHHWVR |\n| Mango Single | B09NQHPCS3 |\n| 2-Pack Truffle | B0CM87YWJR |\n\n### Bill of Materials\n| Component | Part # | Supplier | Cost/Unit |\n|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|\n| Bottle | B320 | Container & Packaging | ~$0.28 |\n| Cap | 24-410 TOTC | Owen Xiang (Alibaba) | $0.025 |\n| Seal | — | Container & Packaging | $0.02 |\n| Label (set) | — | K Sidrane | $0.373 |\n| 6-Pack Box | — | Acorn (Gary) | ~$1.00 |\n\n### Label Colors (Hex)\n| Flavor | Color | Hex |\n|--------|-------|-----|\n| Hot | Red | #b93b35 |\n| Mild | Green | #3ca44f |\n| Mango (Pink) | Pink | #d98095 |\n| Mango (Yellow) | Yellow | #fff06c |\n| Mango (Blue) | Teal | #60a891 |\n| Thai | Purple | #774684 |\n\n### Box Dimensions\n- 3-pack: 7.5\" x 7.5\" x 3.5\"\n- 1-pack: 3.5\" x 3.5\" x 8\"\n\n### Other Business IDs\n- **DUNS Number**: 119248742\n- **Faire Link**: https://www.faire.com/brand/b_4ruezpily0\n- **Dan's Phone**: 908-285-8099\n\n---\n\n## Competitor Positioning\n\n| Competitor | Our Advantage |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| TRUFF | Keto-friendly (they use agave), better value $/oz |\n| Melinda's | Premium quality, authentic Keto |\n| Yellowbird | We lead with truffle premium |\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Traffic is the bottleneck on Amazon**, not conversion — PPC barely running ($66/60d)\n- **Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue** — the star SKU\n- **Mango mystery SOLVED**: 14.7% conversion is market-rate, not a problem\n- **UNFI SoPac (LA) = WHERE THE GROWTH IS**: +516% YoY\n- **UNFI Northeast = declining**: -9% YoY — needs Mango SKU expansion\n- **Mango adds ~7 units/week net** at Whole Foods (34 new -

Truffle dominates (63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion). Traffic is the bottleneck, not conversion.\n\n**Status:** PPC audit complete Feb 12. SRIRACHA AUTO is the #1 campaign (21x ROAS). SD-REMARKETING burning $42/mo for nothing — pause it. Coupons audited — Truffle S&S is a 9:1 winner, renew before Feb 15. Variation family still needs Seller Support call (HOTT2 won't attach).\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Get to $10K/month ASAP |\n| **12 Months** | Achieve maximum revenue in 2026 |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $3,500 | $10,000 | $6,500 |\n| Truffle % of Revenue | 63% | Maintain | --- |\n| Truffle Conversion | 38.7% | 40%+ | +1.3% |\n| PPC ROAS | Varies | 5x+ | --- |\n\n---\n\n## What's Working\n\n- **SRIRACHA AUTO** — 21x ROAS, $43.96 sales on $2.06 spend. #1 campaign.\n- **TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE** — 3x ROAS, competitor targeting on TRUFF's listing works\n- **TT-AUTO-CLOSE** — 24x ROAS (small sample but auto close-match is converting)\n- **TT-AUTO-SUBS** — 7x ROAS (auto substitutes also converting)\n- **Truffle S&S coupon** — 9:1 return ($210 sales / $23 cost)\n- **Truffle dominates** — 63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion\n- **Auto campaigns > Manual** — lower CPCs, better ROAS across the board\n\n---\n\n## Jan 30 Bid Overhaul — COMPLETED\n\n**Root cause found:** Bids were $0.45-$0.55 while Amazon suggested $1.25-$3.38. Post-holiday search volume dropped + competition adjusted = we stopped winning auctions.\n\n### Key Bid Changes\n\n**TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE (Top performer):**\n\n| Keyword | Old Bid | New Bid |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| truffle hot | $0.55 | $1.75 |\n| truffle sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |\n| gourmet hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.30 |\n| small batch hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |\n\n**All Other Manual Campaigns:** Default bid $0.55 → $0.85\n**Auto Campaigns:** Default bid → $0.75\n**SD-REMARKETING:** Budget $3/day → $6/day (Jan 30) — Hit 10.8K impressions, 72 clicks @ $0.06 CPC. Maxed budget. 2 sales (Hot + Sriracha).\n\n---\n\n## Next Actions (Post-Audit Feb 12)\n\n**IMMEDIATE:**\n- [ ] PAUSE SD-REMARKETING — $42.68 spent, 156 clicks, ZERO sales. 45% of all ad spend wasted.\n- [ ] INCREASE SRIRACHA AUTO budget — $10 → $25/day. At 4.69% ACOS / 21x ROAS, every dollar returns $21.\n- [ ] INCREASE TT-AUTO-SUBS + TT-AUTO-CLOSE — $2.50 → $5/day each. Both converted.\n- [ ] RENEW Truffle + Hot S&S coupons before Feb 15. Kill the other 4 (Mild, Mango, Thai, Sriracha S&S = $0 sales).\n- [ ] Audit TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE search terms — 80.99% ACOS. Find which keywords are wasting spend.\n- [ ] Pause or consolidate 14 dead $3/day TT- campaigns — zero impressions.\n\n**NEXT:**\n- [ ] INCREASE TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE — $10 → $15-20/day. 33% ACOS, competitor targeting working.\n- [ ] Start on Organic To-Do list (Premium A+, images, Vine)\n\n**ORGANIC (HIGH PRIORITY):**\n- [ ] Implement Premium A+ Content — Pre-approved!

Auto targeting finding great keywords at $0.17 CPC. Needs way more budget.\n- **Auto campaigns quietly outperform manual**: TT-AUTO-CLOSE (24x ROAS), TT-AUTO-SUBS (7x ROAS), SRIRACHA AUTO (21x ROAS) all beat manual campaigns.\n- **Truffle S&S coupon = 9:1 return**: 33 clips, 13 redeemed, $210.47 sales on $23.40 total cost.\n- **Competitor product targeting works for Truffle**: TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE gets sales by appearing on TRUFF's listing page (33% ACOS).\n- **2-packs convert better than singles**: Mild 2-pack (42.7%) vs Mild single (34.9%)\n- **PPC works when running**: 10x ROAS on \"truffle sauce\", 5.6x overall — just need to turn it on\n- **Brand searches convert**: \"tango hot sauce\" = 85% purchase share\n- **Post-holiday bid adjustment is critical**: Dec→Jan requires bid increases\n- **Phrase match > Exact match**: Phrase finds converting long-tail variations\n\n### Confirmed Failures\n- **Bundles are dead**: 648 sessions, $0 revenue across 7 SKUs. DELETED Jan 22, 2026.\n- **SD-REMARKETING is a money pit**: $42.68 spent (45% of all ad spend), 156 clicks, ZERO sales. Pause immediately.\n- **$3/day campaigns below the bid floor**: 14 TT- campaigns at $3/day got zero impressions.\n- **TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE inefficient at scale**: 81% ACOS. Keywords need audit.\n- **Flat file SUCCESS ≠ action taken**: Amazon processing confirmation unreliable for relationship changes.\n- **Don't fight TRUFF directly**: They own 77K searches for \"truff hot sauce\" — unwinnable\n- **Melinda's conquest doesn't work**: 2,179 impressions, 5 clicks, 0 sales — add as negative\n\n### Mysteries Solved\n- **Mango conversion \"problem\"**: 14.7% is market-rate for category (13.8% average). Not broken.\n\n### Key Gaps Identified\n- **\"truffle hot sauce\" conversion gap**: We get 3% of 17,573 monthly searches but only 1.4% of purchases.\n- **Sriracha invisible**: 22% conversion but only 177 sessions total. Outside variation family.\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Feb 12, 2026 | Full PPC + Coupon + Variation audit | SRIRACHA AUTO = star (21x ROAS). SD-REMARKETING = waste ($42.68/0 sales). Truffle S&S = 9:1 return. | Auto > manual. SD remarketing doesn't work. S&S coupons compound. |\n| Feb 11, 2026 | Uploaded v8 variation flat file | Deleted 2 dupes.

Standard negatives: truff, melinda's. |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Deleted 7 bundles | 648 sessions, $0 revenue eliminated | Bundles don't work in hot sauce category. |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | PPC Campaign Review | 9 campaigns, 3 paused. 17.86% ACOS, 5.6x ROAS overall. | PPC infrastructure works — just needs budget |\n| Jan 20, 2026 | Deep analysis of Business Reports | Found traffic bottleneck, Mango mystery solved | Focus on traffic, not conversion |\n\n---\n\n## Top Converting Search Terms\n\n| Search Term | Campaign | Impressions | Sales | Notes |\n|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|\n| \"truffle sauce\" | TT-PHRASE | 7,836 | 4 | 10x+ ROAS — WINNER |\n| \"tango truffle hot sauce\" | TT-PHRASE | 63 | 3 | Brand + product |\n| \"tango hot sauce\" | TT-PT-COMP | 10 | 2 | Brand defense |\n| B07HMJWCNL (TRUFF ASIN) | TT-PT-COMP | 5,494 | 2 | Competitor conquest |\n\n### Problem Terms (High Impressions, No Sales)\n- \"truffle hot sauce\" exact — 11,909 impressions, 0 sales\n- \"black truffle hot sauce\" — lots of impressions, no conversions\n- Melinda's conquest — 2,179 impressions, 0 sales → Add as negative\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Context\n\n**vs TRUFF (main competitor):**\n- We WIN on price (16% better value), size (33% more product), health (keto-friendly, carrot-based vs their agave)\n- We LOSE on reviews (302 vs 34,744), BSR (#393 vs #6), content quality\n- **Strategy**: Don't fight head-on. Position as healthier, better-value alternative.\n\n---\n\n## SKU Reference\n\n### SKU Generation History\n- **Gen 1 (Old):** TCSH, TCSM, TT — original SKUs (mostly gone)\n- **Gen 2 (Auto-gen):** GX-ELCK-FRPF, U4-ZJKD-O0BK — Amazon gibberish\n- **Gen 3a (Current no-dash):** TRUFFLETANGO, THAITANGO, MANGOTANGO — Amazon barcode (FNSKU required)\n- **Gen 3b (Manufacturer barcode):** HOT-TANGO, THAI-TANGO, etc. — no labeling\n\n**EXCEPTION:** TRUFFLETANGO stays active. TRUFFLE-TANGO saved for future own-UPC product.\n\n### Truffle Tango — Jimmy/Truffleist History\nJimmy from The Truffleist owns the UPC on current Truffle label. Collab since 2018 — he sends truffle flavoring, Dan manufactures all units, both sell independently (verbal agreement). Risk: manufacturer barcode = Jimmy's UPC, so Amazon could misassign inventory. Plan: new truffle product with Dan's own branding + UPC.\n\n### Product Lineup Vision\n**Core sauces:** 6 flavors × 4 pack sizes (1-pk, 2-pk, 3-pk, 6-pk) = **24 clean listings**\n**Future products:** Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk, Chips, Popcorn\n\n### Pricing Structure\n**Singles:** Hot $10, Mild $10, Mango $10, Thai $10, Truffle $17\n**2-Packs:** Hot $18, Mild $18, Mango $18, Thai $18, Truffle $30\n**6-Packs:** Hot $40, Mild $40, Mango $40, Thai $40, Truffle $75\n\n### Bundle Concepts (Bundles DELETED Jan 22 — 648 sessions, $0 revenue)\n*Historical reference only — bundles confirmed dead in hot sauce category*\n- Original Flavors: 1 Hot + 1 Mild — $18\n- Heat Seekers: 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $18\n- Starter Sauce: 1 Mild + 1 Mango — $18\n- New Flavors: 1 Thai + 1 Mango — $18\n- Heat Range: 1 Mild + 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $26\n- Tango Sampler: 1 Hot + 1 Mild + 1 Mango + 1 Thai — $34\n- Party of 5: 1 each of all — $40\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What's the right PPC daily budget ceiling before diminishing returns?\n- Should we kill Dragon Jelly (7.7% conversion, $390 total)?\n- Should we delete the 5 OOS six-packs (OOS 1-3 years)?\n- What's causing the \"truffle hot sauce\" conversion gap? Price? Images? Reviews vs TRUFF?\n\n---\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n| Date | Finding | Source | Expires |\n|------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Feb 12, 2026 | PPC AUDIT: 7 purchases, $108.92 sales, $77.07 spent.

    "content": "# Tango x Costco — Brain\n\n**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month\n**Weight:** 15%\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\n**UNBLOCKED.** Moses call happened Feb 4, 2026. He's in. Roadshows are happening.\n\nThe format has pivoted from the old 16oz 2-pack idea to a **3-pack of 8oz bottles (Hot + Sriracha + Truffle) at ~$19 retail.** This is smarter — no new bottle size to develop, uses our existing 8oz format, and the perceived value is insane (Truffle alone is $17 on Amazon).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Moses assigns 5 Costco locations (mix of A/B/C stores)\n2. We demo our 3-4 best sellers across 5 stores in 5 days\n3. Target: $10,000 total sales revenue across the 5 days\n4. Ship 1 pallet per flavor per store ahead of demos\n5. Costco returns unsold product (consignment)\n6. After roadshow data, we discuss the \"club case\" — the permanent Costco offering\n\n**Timeline:** ~3 months from call (targeting May 2026)\n\n**The $10K target math:**\n- At $19/three-pack: 527 packs across 5 days = ~105/day\n- That's 1 sale every 3-4 minutes over an 8-hour demo day\n- Costco foot traffic is massive — doable but aggressive\n\n**Key insight from the call:** Moses initially said Dan picks 5 stores, then later said he'd assign an A store, 2 B stores, and 2 C stores. He's curating the locations — that's a good sign, he's thinking about this strategically.\n\n**Deck status (Feb 17):** We have a 3-slide roadshow proposal deck (Bootstrap HTML). Currently reworking the tone — less aggressive sales pitch, more collaborative proposal. Moses is already interested; we don't need to hard-sell. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Finalize 3-pack format, begin production planning for roadshow inventory |\n| **3 Months** | Execute 5-store roadshow, hit $10K sales target |\n| **12 Months** | Prove velocity → secure inline placement → $5K/month recurring |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Roadshows/month | 0 | 2 | +2 |\n| Units/roadshow | 0 | 400 | +400 |\n| Inline placement | No | Yes | — |\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Role | Email | Phone |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Moses Romero** | Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery | mosesromero@costco.com | 714-741-2208 |\n| David Liuzzi | Previous contact (moved desks) | dliuzzi@costco.com | 714-741-7787 |\n\n- Moses prefers **phone calls over email** — don't email, call\n\n---\n\n## 3-Pack Proposal\n\n### Product Format\n\n**Format:** 3 × 8oz squeeze bottles — Hot, Sriracha, Truffle\n**Retail price:** $19.00\n\n**Why this combo:**\n- **Hot** — OG best seller, always #1\n- **Sriracha** — Cheapest COGS ($2.74), clean Huy Fong alternative, massive category\n- **Truffle** — Premium differentiator, $17 standalone on Amazon, best TRUFF competitor on market\n- Sriracha and truffle are two of the most popular hot sauce flavors of all time — broad appeal in a Costco demo environment\n\n**Why $19 is genius:**\n- Truffle alone retails for $17 on Amazon\n- Customer gets 3 full-size bottles for $19 = insane perceived value\n- Trial machine — they taste 3 flavors, become repeat buyers across all channels\n\n### The Math\n\n| Component | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Hot COGS | $3.49 |\n| Sriracha COGS | $2.74 |\n| Truffle COGS | $3.34 |\n| 3-pack packaging (est.) | ~$0.75 |\n| **Total COGS per 3-pack** | **~$10.32** |\n\n| Line Item | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Retail price | $19.00 |\n| Costco's cut (~15%) | $2.85 |\n| **Tango receives** | **~$16.15** |\n| COGS | ~$10.32 |\n| **Gross profit per 3-pack** | **~$5.83** |\n| **Margin** | **~36%** |\n| Member value per bottle | $6.33 vs $9.99 retail (37% savings) |\n\n### Roadshow Revenue Scenario ($10K target)\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Target revenue | $10,000 |\n| 3-packs needed | ~527 |\n| Per day (5 days) | ~105/day |\n| Sales pace | 1 sale every 3-4 min |\n| Gross profit on $10K | ~$3,100 |\n\n### Inventory Exposure (5 stores)\n\n| Item | Quantity |\n|------|----------|\n| 3-packs to produce | ~1,250 |\n| Total bottles needed | ~3,750 |\n| Bottles per flavor | ~1,250 each (Hot, Sriracha, Truffle) |\n| COGS exposure | ~$12,900 |\n| **Risk mitigation** | **Costco returns unsold product** |\n\n### Recurring Revenue Path\n- $19/pack × 100 units/day × 4 days = $7,600/roadshow\n- 1 roadshow/month = ~$7,600\n- Inline placement = recurring without demo staffing\n\n---\n\n## Blockers\n\n| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |\n|---------------|-----|----------------|\n| 3-pack packaging design | Need to design sleeve/box for 3-pack | Source packaging options, get quotes |\n| Inventory production | Need ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) for 5 stores | Schedule cook + pack shifts with Aria |\n| Store assignments | Moses will assign A/B/C stores | Follow up with Moses closer to roadshow date |\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- ✅ **Positive taste reviews from David's team** (Aug 2024)\n- ✅ **Roadshow → Inline path confirmed** — Prove velocity first\n- ✅ **Moses is IN** (Feb 4, 2026) — Roadshows approved, 5 stores in ~3 months\n- ✅ **$10K target across 5 days** — aggressive but doable at $19/3-pack (~105 packs/day)\n- ✅ **Moses curating store mix** — 1 A store, 2 B stores, 2 C stores (he's thinking strategically)\n- ✅ **Costco returns unsold product** — consignment model, inventory risk is manageable\n- ✅ **3-pack pivot is smarter than 16oz 2-pack** — no new bottle size, better margins, trial-focused\n- ✅ **Hot + Sriracha + Truffle is the killer combo** — OG + trending + premium, $10.32 COGS for $19 retail\n- ✅ **Roadshows precede the \"club case\"** — Moses wants sales data first, then decides permanent format\n- ✅ **Demo your 3-4 best sellers** — Moses said to bring top flavors for demos, club case discussion comes after\n- ✅ **Deck messaging insight (Feb 17):** Don't tell the buyer how his store works. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions. \"Proposed format\" energy, not \"here's why we're right\" energy.\n- ✅ **Priority stack insight (Feb 17):** The deck is polish work. The load-bearing walls are: (1) Cash — how do we fund ~$12,900 in inventory by May? (2) Production — book Aria NOW. (3) Packaging — need quotes this week, 4-8 week lead time. The deck matters less than we think because Moses already said yes. Its real purpose is giving Moses ammunition to champion Tango internally — \"make Moses look good to his boss\" energy, not \"convince Moses\" energy.\n- ✅ **$10K reframe (Feb 17):** The $10K target is Moses's number. If we hit $7K, that's still incredible velocity data for inline placement. Don't treat it as pass/fail.\n\n---\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n| Date | Action | Result | Learning |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Feb 17, 2026 | Reworking deck tone | In progress | Less salesy, more collaborative |\n| Feb 4, 2026 | **Phone call with Moses** | **🎉 ROADSHOWS APPROVED** | 5 stores, 5 days, ~3 months out. $10K target. He assigns A/B/C store mix. 1 pallet/flavor/store. Costco returns unsold. Club case discussion comes after roadshow data. |\n| Jan 15, 2026 | Moses sampling internally | Positive → led to call | This is the gate |\n| Jan 7, 2026 | Confirmed sample delivery | Delivered | Good to follow up |\n| Dec 23, 2025 | Sent samples to Moses | Delivered | — |\n| Dec 2025 | David intro'd Moses | New relationship | David moved desks, Moses is buyer now |\n| Aug 2024 | Discussed roadshow model | Interest confirmed | 16oz 2-pack + consignment model |\n| Jun 2024 | Sent samples to David | Positive reviews | Team liked the taste |\n| Apr 2024 | First contact with David | Relationship started | Long nurture cycle is normal |\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What does the 3-pack packaging look like? Sleeve? Box? Shrink wrap?\n- Exact Costco margin — is it really 14-15% or does it vary?\n- Which 5 stores will Moses assign? (He said he'll pick A/B/C mix)\n- Staffing: Can we hire demo staff or does Dan need to be there all 5 days?\n- What sampling supplies does Costco provide vs. what do we bring?\n- Do we demo individual bottles or the 3-pack itself?\n- What's the lead time from Moses confirming stores to demo dates?\n- Production capacity: Can Aria handle ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) on top of regular UNFI/Amazon orders?\n- Should we bring all 6 flavors for sampling even if the 3-pack is Hot/Sriracha/Truffle?\n- What does Moses need from us to finalize? Pricing sheet? Product specs?\n\n---\n\n## Roadshow Logistics Checklist\n\n| Item | Status | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 3-pack packaging (sleeve/box) | ❌ | Need to design + source.

    "content": "# Tango DTC — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales are currently $0. This is an untapped channel with real potential — we have an email list in Klaviyo, a Shopify store, and a domain that just need to be cleaned up and activated.\n\n**The Email Situation:** Dan previously used Klaviyo for email marketing, but deliverability tanked badly — most subscribers weren't seeing emails. Cancelled Klaviyo due to cost vs poor open rates. DNS was updated at that time but hasn't been checked in months. List is still in Klaviyo (account may be downgraded, not closed — need to verify).\n\n**Domain:** tangochilesauce.com. Email handled by IONOS. Shopify store exists.\n\n**14-Day Sprint Plan (Feb 14-28):** Clean DNS → export list → warm up with Shopify Email → drive first DTC sales.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- Klaviyo deliverability was destroyed — domain had stale Klaviyo DNS records left behind\n- **DNS audit (Feb 17, 2026):** DMARC is solid (p=quarantine, 100%, reports to postmaster@). SPF has STALE Klaviyo + SendGrid includes. DKIM has two stale Klaviyo signing keys still live. MX records are clean (IONOS).\n- Domain DNS was \"updated\" when Klaviyo cancelled but Klaviyo ghosts were left in — `include:klaviyo-mail.com` and `include:sendgrid.net` still in SPF, `kl._domainkey` and `kl2._domainkey` DKIM records still active\n- Email list is dormant — needs tiered re-engagement, NOT a blast to everyone\n- **Shopify Email is the play** — 10K free emails/mo, no branding, native Shopify integration, zero extra cost. Beats MailerLite (500 contact cap), Brevo (300/day limit), Mailchimp (250 contacts lol)\n- Klaviyo data retention: if account was downgraded (not fully closed), all data is still there. If fully closed, data is permanently deleted\n- Re-engagement math: expect 5-15% of dormant list to re-engage, 1-2% conversion on openers\n- First email should NOT be a sale — \"we're back\" personal note to generate positive signals\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n- Klaviyo for email marketing — cancelled due to poor deliverability + high cost (date unknown, months ago)\n- Updated domain DNS settings when Klaviyo was cancelled — but left stale Klaviyo records behind\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- ~~What domain is sending from?~~ **ANSWERED: tangochilesauce.com, IONOS mail**\n- ~~What's the current SPF/DKIM/DMARC status?~~ **ANSWERED: DMARC good, SPF/DKIM have stale Klaviyo refs**\n- ~~Is the Shopify store set up?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, exists**\n- ~~What email platform to use?~~ **ANSWERED: Shopify Email (10K free, native, no branding)**\n- What's the current email list size? How old is it? When was the last send?\n- Can Dan still log into Klaviyo to export the list?\n- Is anyone monitoring postmaster@tangochilesauce.com for DMARC reports?\n- DTC pricing strategy — same as Amazon? Higher? Bundle deals?\n- Social media following / other traffic sources to pair with email?\n\n## Short-Term Goal\n\n**This month (Feb 2026):** Clean DNS → export list from Klaviyo → warm up via Shopify Email → drive first direct sales\n\n## Long-Term Goal\n\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo DTC revenue stream\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] **Log into Klaviyo** — export full subscriber list as CSV (if account still accessible)\n- [ ] **Clean DNS in IONOS** — remove klaviyo-mail.com from SPF, remove sendgrid.net from SPF, delete kl._domainkey CNAME, delete kl2._domainkey CNAME\n- [ ] **Run domain health checks** — MXToolbox.com blacklist check, Sender Score, Google Postmaster Tools\n- [ ] **Verify exported list** — run through NeverBounce/ZeroBounce free tier, kill dead emails\n- [ ] **Set up Shopify Email** — Marketing section in Shopify admin, add Shopify SPF/DKIM to DNS\n- [ ] **Segment list into tiers** — Tier 1 (50-100 known/recent), Tier 2 (100-200 moderate), Tier 3 (rest)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 1** — \"We're Back\" personal note from Dan, no sale\n- [ ] **Send Tier 1** — monitor opens/bounces/complaints for 24hr\n- [ ] **Send Tier 2** — if Tier 1 clean\n- [ ] **Send Tier 3** — if Tier 2 clean\n- [ ] **Draft Email 2** — value content (recipe, brand story, behind the scenes)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 3** — THE OFFER (discount code / bundle / free shipping)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 4** — \"Last chance\" urgency\n- [ ] Redesign Tango website/Shopify store for DTC sales\n- [ ] Set up DTC pricing / promotions / bundles\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n- [x] DNS audit — completed Feb 17, found stale Klaviyo records\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Domain DNS audit (Feb 17) — identified stale SPF includes + DKIM keys\n- [x] Platform research — Shopify Email selected (10K free, native, no branding)\n- [x] Re-engagement strategy designed — 4-email tiered warmup over 14 days\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n**Email Platform Free Tiers (Feb 2026):**\n| Platform | Free Emails/mo | Free Contacts | Branding? | Winner? |\n|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|---------|\n| Shopify Email | 10,000 | Unlimited | No watermark | ✅ YES |\n| MailerLite | 12,000 | 500 | Yes | Too small |\n| Brevo | ~9,000 (300/day) | 100,000 | Yes | Backup option |\n| Mailchimp | 500 | 250 | Yes | Avoid |\n| Klaviyo Free | 500 | 250 | Yes | Too small |\n\n**DNS Records to Clean (IONOS panel):**\n| Action | Record | What to Remove |\n|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:klaviyo-mail.com` |\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:sendgrid.net` (if no active SendGrid use) |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl._domainkey | Points to kl.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl2._domainkey | Points to kl2.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n\n**Re-Engagement Timeline:**\n- Email 1 (Day 3): \"We're back\" — personal, no sale\n- Email 2 (Day 6-7): Value content — recipe/story\n- Email 3 (Day 10): THE OFFER — discount/bundle\n- Email 4 (Day 12-14): \"Last chance\" urgency\n\n**Expected Results (1,000 person list):**\n- ~150 re-engage (15%)\n- ~10 buy (7% of engaged)\n- ~$250 revenue from sprint\n- Real value: clean engaged list for long-term DTC channel\n\n## Files\n\n*Shopify store: [need URL]*\n*Klaviyo account: [need to check if accessible]*\n*Located at: /Projects/🔥 tango/website/ (if exists)*\n",

Tango is my brand, I made my first batch in 2013 in\nmy tiny apartment in NYC, just trying to make my own blend of my grandma's\nfamous 'chile' that she used to make for her neighbors and friends in\nHonduras. I designed the logo, built the website, put it in the bottle,\neverything. 9 years and 6 flavors later, I still uphold the same ingredient\nlist and values that she promoted in her original creation. All clean,\ndelicious ingredients, no sugar or preservatives. Tango is a family\nbusiness, a labor of love. I still own 100% of the business, there are\nno investors involved. We wake up and eat Tango and then get to work\nmaking it. We love it, and we love anybody who loves it.. and that's everybody!\n```\n\n---\n\n# DM OUTREACH\n\n## Goal: 225 Reachouts/Day\n\n## Final DM Template (Tested Nov 2022)\n```\nHey [name]!

Until this sauce.\" — **Mindya Owne, Facebook**\n\n> \"Are you kidding? Usually you take a bland food and add spices... with tango, you start with tango and say what can I add to this?\" — **Mitch Rosenthal, Facebook**\n\n> \"It's got an awesome flavor with garlic and peppers at the forefront. Does not have a vinegar taste. Very mild heat, but the flavor is one of my new favorites.\" — **Annie, Amazon**\n\n> \"Awesomely spicy without the sugar. Bought it for Whole30 and will be buying more.\" — **Amazon Review**\n\n> \"This is delicious hot sauce! It tastes like it's habanero based which adds a yummy complexity.

There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise.\"\n\n## Key Selling Points (Master List)\nCarrot-Based, Vegan, No Preservatives, No Sugar, No Gums, Plant-Based, Organic Ingredients, 6 Incredible Spicy Flavors, 100% Clean Ingredients, Easy-To-Use Squeeze Bottle, Handmade in Small Batches in CA, Grandma's Recipe, Born in Brooklyn, Rich In Vitamins, Gluten-Free, American Made, Family-Owned, Independent, Good on Everything, 98%+ sell-through rate, Cold-fill certified\n\n## Deep Tango Speech (Dan's Philosophy)\n\"There may be no more pursuit more shared by all walks of life than eating. Hot sauce, makes eating, better. Ideally in 5 ways: Adds flavor to your food, enhances all the flavors in the food, adds color, introduces spice-heat (a nervous system excitement mechanism). Hot sauce is also kind of a solidy liquid or a liquidy solid. It has pour physics. It incorporates so many qualities of the universe — Nature, Physiology, Sensation, Temperature, Physics, Flow, Chemistry, Fire, Flavor, Eating, Fun, Courage, Experience.\"\n\n## Tagline Ideas\n- \"Choose discomfort.\"\n- \"There's billions of tango fans most just haven't tried it yet\"\n- \"The only hot sauce you crave more than the food u put it on\"\n- \"Sauce so good it hurts\"\n- \"Flavor heaven\"\n- \"High quality Chile sauce\"\n\n---\n\n# E-COMMERCE FRAMEWORK (2022)\n\n## C x F x AOV\n- **C (Customers)**: Ads, Email, IG, Influencer, SEO, Content, PR, Website\n- **F (Frequency)**: Mainly email.

    "content": "# Tango x UNFI — Brain\n\n**Target:** $10,000/month | **Current:** $3,400/month | **Gap:** $6,600\n**Weight:** 25%\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\nUNFI is Tango's wholesale distribution channel, getting us into grocery stores via two distribution centers: Moreno Valley (SoPac/LA) and Hudson Valley (Northeast/NYC). We're in the UpNext emerging brands program.\n\n**Status:** SoPac is growing +516% YoY. Northeast needs SKU expansion (no Mango). Endless Aisle paperwork blocking new store access.\n\n### UpNext Crisis Context\nOn **May 21, 2025**, Brittney sent a termination notice. UpNext is a 2-year program — we've been in it since 2018 (7 years). Reason: \"not meeting sales thresholds for graduation.\" Decision reversed May 22 after Dan's response. Monthly check-ins established. **The $10K/month goal isn't just nice-to-have, it's survival.**\n\n### Core Philosophy: Density Before Scale\n\"Store count is vanity. Velocity is sanity.\" Brands that dominate two distribution centers before expanding have 3-4x better outcomes. Current WF velocity: ~1.6 units/store/week. Target: 3+ units/store/week = 2x current sales without adding stores.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Get to $10K/month ASAP |\n| **12 Months** | Graduate from UpNext ($300K annual) |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $3,400 | $10,000 | $6,600 |\n| SoPac YoY | +516% | Maintain | --- |\n| Northeast YoY | -9% | +20% | Needs Mango |\n| Store Count | ~50 | 200+ | +150 |\n| WF Velocity | ~1.6 units/store/week | 3+ | 2x needed |\n\n---\n\n## Growth Strategy Tree\n\n```\nUNFI $10K Goal\n├── Whole Foods (existing) ───────────── 25%\n│   ├── SoPac stores — GROWING +516% YoY\n│   └── Northeast stores — DECLINING -9% YoY\n│\n├── Whole Foods (expansion via John Lawson) ─ 25%\n│   ├── SKU expansion — get all 6 flavors\n│   └── New regions — Rocky Mountain, Midwest\n│\n└── New Store Outreach ──────────────── 50%\n    ├── LA/SoCal (65%) ← WHERE THE GROWTH IS\n    │   ├── Erewhon (10 stores) — TOP PRIORITY\n    │   ├── Bristol Farms + Lazy Acres (20)\n    │   └── Gelson's (27)\n    └── NYC/Northeast (35%)\n        ├── Wegmans (50)\n        └── DeCicco's (14)\n```\n\n## Revenue Math\n\n| Source | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Existing WF velocity | $3,400 | $4,500 | +$1,100 |\n| WF SKU expansion (John Lawson) | $0 | $2,000 | +$2,000 |\n| WF new regions (John Lawson) | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |\n| New LA chains | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |\n| New NYC chains | $0 | $500 | +$500 |\n| **Total** | **$3,400** | **$10,000** | **+$6,600** |\n\n## Why LA First?\n\n| Region | WF Stores | YoY Growth |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| SoPac (LA) | 48 | **+516%** |\n| Northeast (NYC) | 53 | **-9%** |\n\nLA is exploding.

Would open that door but adds distributor complexity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Role | Status | Last Contact |\n|------|------|--------|-------------|\n| John Lawson | Whole Foods buyer | Awaiting response | Jan 20, 2026 |\n| Lauren Martinez | Erewhon Brand Mgmt | Warm lead | Sep 2025 |\n| Zulma Cienfuegos | Erewhon Buyer (Purchasing) | — | — |\n| Maren Giuliano | Erewhon Buyer (20+ yrs organic) | — | — |\n| Brittney Langlois | UNFI UpNext SDM (blanglois@unfi.com) | Monthly check-ins | May 2025 |\n| Jennifer Warner Jo | UNFI Moreno Valley Buyer | — | — |\n| Shawn Lantry | UNFI Hudson Valley | — | — |\n| Catherine Garcia | UNFI Hudson Valley | — | — |\n\n---\n\n## Endless Aisle Paperwork Status\n\n**Location:** `/tango/distribution/unfi/endless aisle/`\n\n| Step | Form | Status |\n|------|------|--------|\n| 1 | Supplier Checklist | Done (existing supplier info) |\n| 2 | W-9 | Need fresh copy |\n| 3 | New Supplier Application | Fill with existing vendor info |\n| 4 | ACH Form | Need banking info |\n| 5-10 | Item Setup Documents | Use Moreno Valley specs |\n| 11 | Insurance COI | Get from RSC |\n| 12 | Food Safety Audit | Done (promissory note) |\n| 13 | Quality Assurance Agreement | Review and sign |\n\n---\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n| Date | Finding | Source | Expires |\n|------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Erewhon uses KeHE, NOT UNFI — UNFI distribution doesn't help here | KeHE press release | Ongoing |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Bristol Farms uses RangeMe — submit there + direct outreach | Research | Ongoing |\n| Jan 22, 2026 | Gelson's = premium LA positioning — fits Tango, same UNFI DC | Research | Ongoing |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening West Hollywood Feb 2026 | WestsideCurrent | Feb 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening Glendale May 2026 | WestsideCurrent | May 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening Thousand Oaks July 2026 | Conejo Valley Guide | July 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon opening NYC flagship late 2026 — first East Coast location | Modern Retail | Q4 2026 |\n| Jan 21, 2026 | Erewhon vendor requirements: Non-GMO + USDA Organic preferred, no refined sugar | Modern Retail | Ongoing |\n\n---\n\n*Migrated from Notion (Tango x UNFI) — Feb 17, 2026*\n",
