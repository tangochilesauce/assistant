    "content": "# JEFF State — Last Updated Feb 17, 2026 (Session 3)\n\nThis is the boot-up file. Read this first every session.\n\n## What Happened This Session\n\n### Big Wins\n- **Brain page built** — Every project now has a Brain tab that renders the actual brain markdown files in the JEFF app. Nothing hidden from Dan anymore.\n- **Brain build pipeline** — `scripts/build-brain.mjs` reads all brain files at build time, writes to `src/data/brain.ts`. Runs automatically via `prebuild` hook on every Vercel deploy.\n- **Compact text rendering** — Brain pages use tiny text (11px body, 10px tables) so you can see maximum content per screen.\n- **DTC email recovery plan** — Full research done: DNS audit, platform comparison, 4-email tiered re-engagement strategy, 14-day sprint timeline.\n- **All brain files updated** — Every active project now has a rich, comprehensive brain file with strategy, learnings, metrics, pipelines, and intel.\n- **13 DTC todos added** — Full email recovery pipeline in Supabase under tango-dtc.\n- **Dan refactored project detail page** — Brain and Notes are now inline tabs on the project page (not separate routes). Smart move.\n\n### Previous Session (Feb 17, Session 2)\n- Vercel deployed — JEFF live at assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n- Tango Dashboard deployed (GitHub Pages)\n- Orders pipeline built on Tango Dashboard\n- Notes system built (Supabase + Zustand + UI)\n- UNFI sub-project added\n- Waiting column removed, sidebar scroll fixed\n- FFEEDD brand messaging captured\n\n### Previous Session (Feb 16-17, Session 1)\n- Imported 34 schedule items into Supabase\n- Built deadline tag system\n- Added Goals dashboard, Completed log, financial sidebar, sprint banner\n- Square apple-icon for iPhone\n\n## Current Pipeline Snapshot\n\n### ✅ Done (This Session)\n- Brain page built (per-project, renders markdown)\n- Brain build pipeline (prebuild → brain.ts)\n- Compact text rendering\n- DTC email recovery research + plan\n- All brain files updated to full depth\n- 13 DTC email pipeline todos added to Supabase\n- DTC brain: DNS audit, Shopify Email selected, 4-email strategy designed\n- JEFF brain: corrected from \"GitHub Pages\" to Vercel, full architecture documented\n\n### 📋 To Do (Next Priority)\n- **DTC Sprint (URGENT):**\n  - Log into Klaviyo → export list\n  - Clean DNS in IONOS (remove stale Klaviyo SPF/DKIM)\n  - Set up Shopify Email\n  - Send first re-engagement email\n- **Amazon:** Restart PPC ($10-20/day on Truffle)\n- **Madder:** Single drops 2/22 (5 days away)\n- **Costco:** Call Moses T-F this week\n- **UNFI:** Follow up John Lawson, Endless Aisle paperwork\n- **Orders system v2:** Supabase-backed orders + drop zone intake\n- **Dream Beds:** Batch video sessions\n\n## Active Projects\n\n| Project | Weight | Status | Current Goal |\n|---------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| 🔥 Tango | 65% | Active | Ship EXP pallet, fix Amazon PPC, close DTC sales |\n| 🔥 → Amazon | 25% | Active | Restart PPC, optimize Truffle listing |\n| 🔥 → Costco | 15% | Active | Close roadshow deal with Moses |\n| 🔥 → UNFI | 25% | Active | SKU expansion into Northeast, complete Endless Aisle |\n| 🔥 → DTC | 5% | **SPRINT** | Clean DNS → export list → warm up → drive sales |\n| 📱 FFEEDD | 15% | Launched | Get first 15 paid downloads |\n| 🤖 JEFF | 10% | Building | Brain page live, all files visible to Dan |\n| 🎸 Madder | 5% | Active | Drop single 2/22, build pre-save to 50+ |\n| 🎬 Dream Beds | 5% | Active | Upload 28 videos, hit 100 subs |\n| 🏠 Life Admin | 0% | Always | Pay all bills on time |\n\n## 14-Day Sprint (Feb 14-28)\n**Goal:** Ship pallet · Restart PPC · Drop single · Launch FFEEDD · DTC email push\n**Target:** $5,000 new revenue\n**Day:** 4 of 14\n\n## Key Blockers\n\n- **DTC:** Need to log into Klaviyo to confirm list is accessible (if account was fully closed, list is gone)\n- **DTC:** Stale Klaviyo DNS records need cleaning in IONOS before any sends\n- **UNFI:** John Lawson response needed for NE SKU expansion\n- **UNFI:** Endless Aisle paperwork incomplete\n- **Amazon:** PPC barely running (~$66/60d) — massive untapped lever\n- **Cash:** Balance ~$45, tight until UNFI MOR (~Feb 23) and EXP invoice (~Mar 21)\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Channel | Role | Status |\n|------|---------|------|--------|\n| Moses Romero | Costco | Asst Buyer, D13 | Roadshows discussion, call T-F |\n| John Lawson | UNFI/WF | Whole Foods buyer | Follow up needed |\n| Brittney Langlois | UNFI | UpNext SDM | Monthly check-ins |\n| Lauren Martinez | Erewhon | Brand Management | Warm lead from 2022 |\n\n## Financial Snapshot\n\n- Balance: ~$45\n- Monthly in: ~$12,144 (Amazon $1,900 + UNFI SoPac $3,422 + UNFI NE $3,422 + EXP $3,400)\n- Monthly out: ~$4,037+ (Rent $2,878 + Insurance $376 + Storage $350 + Studio $300 + Claude $100 + PPC $33)\n- Net: positive but tight — timing matters\n\n## System Architecture\n\n- **JEFF app:** /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/jeff/ (Next.js 16, Vercel)\n- **JEFF live:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app (auto-deploys from GitHub main)\n- **Tango Dashboard:** tangochilesauce.github.io/tango-dashboard/ (GitHub Pages)\n- **Brain files:** /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/jeff/brain/ → built to src/data/brain.ts on deploy\n- **Supabase:** muowpjabnjkqgwgzfmoj.supabase.co (tables: todos, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline, notes)\n- **GitHub repos:** tangochilesauce/assistant (JEFF), tangochilesauce/tango-dashboard\n",

    "content": "# Dream Beds — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDream Beds is a YouTube channel about bed reviews/content. Goal is consistent daily uploads to build the channel. Has a custom video pipeline system (**Dreamwatch**) that syncs local queue state to Supabase for real-time monitoring in JEFF.\n\nThe channel is in growth mode — volume of uploads matters more than polish right now. Batch production sessions maximize output per day.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Batch production is the play** — record multiple videos in one session, then process/upload over time\n- **Dreamwatch pipeline works** — automated encode → upload → publish workflow monitored in JEFF\n- **Queue path uses underscore**: `_ queue/` (not `! queue` — this was a bug that was fixed Feb 2026)\n- **Shorts + cross-posting** doubles distribution without extra recording time\n- **Consistency beats quality** at this stage — need 100 subs to unlock monetization features\n\n## System Architecture\n\n- **Queue path:** `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/_ queue/`\n- **Sync daemon:** `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/scripts/dreamwatch_sync.py`\n- **Dreamwatch page in JEFF:** `/dreamwatch` — real-time pipeline status (polls Supabase every 5s)\n- **Supabase table:** `dreamwatch_pipeline` — tracks encode progress, upload status, YouTube URLs\n- **Pipeline states:** STEP0_META → STEP1 → ... → PUBLISHED\n- **Card statuses:** ACTIVE, QUEUED, PUBLISHED, FAILED, UNPAIRED_VIDEO, UNPAIRED_THUMB\n\n### How It Works\n1. Drop video + thumbnail into `_ queue/` folder\n2. Dreamwatch daemon detects new files, starts encoding\n3. Progress syncs to Supabase in real-time\n4. JEFF's Dreamwatch page shows live encode %, upload %, ETA\n5. Video publishes to YouTube, URL captured in Supabase\n\n## Strategy\n\n1. **Batch 7 videos per session** — maximize studio time\n2. **Cut Shorts from long-form** — 5 Shorts per batch\n3. **Cross-post to TikTok + Reels** — same content, 3x distribution\n4. **Hit 100 subs** — unlock community posts, stories, channel customization\n5. **28 videos in February** — daily upload cadence\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What's the current subscriber count?\n- How many videos uploaded so far?\n- What's the average view count per video?\n- Which video topics/types perform best?\n- Any revenue from existing videos?\n- Is the dreamwatch_sync.py daemon running reliably?\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Upload 28 videos, hit 100 subscribers\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo (ad revenue + sponsorships + affiliate links)\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] Batch 7 videos (next session)\n- [ ] Cut 5 Shorts from existing long-form\n- [ ] Cross-post to TikTok + Reels\n- [ ] Batch another 7 videos (second session)\n- [ ] Review analytics — what's working, what's not\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n(depends on current session status)\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Dreamwatch pipeline built and deployed\n- [x] Queue path fixed (`_ queue/` not `! queue`)\n- [x] Dreamwatch page live in JEFF\n\n## Files\n\n*Located at: /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/*\n- scripts/ — automation scripts (dreamwatch_sync.py)\n- _ queue/ — upload workflow queue\n",

It launched with a **$1 upfront + 60-day grace period + $1/mo subscription** model. Currently monitoring initial downloads and user feedback.\n\nThe app is live. Now it's about getting it in front of people.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **\"Quiet personal thoughts\"** is the core positioning — intimate, private, no social pressure\n- Pricing model: $1 upfront filters for quality users, 60-day grace gives them time to build the habit, $1/mo is low enough to not cause churn\n- App is built and submitted — the hard part (building) is done, now it's marketing\n- Has its own CLAUDE.md with FFEEDD-specific instructions at `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/ffeedd/CLAUDE.md`\n\n## Brand / Messaging\n\n- **Core tagline:** \"Quiet personal thoughts\" — use for App Store subtitle, marketing materials, landing page hero\n- **Positioning:** Private journaling, no social features, no sharing, no followers. Just you and your thoughts.\n- **Tone:** Calm, understated, intimate. The anti-social-media journal.\n\n## Strategy\n\n1. **App Store optimization** — subtitle uses \"quiet personal thoughts,\" screenshots show the calm UI\n2. **Reddit marketing blitz** — r/journaling, r/mentalhealth, r/productivity, r/iosapps. Authentic posts, not ads.\n3. **TikTok screen recordings** — show the app in use, the clean UI, the privacy angle. \"This is where I write things I don't post.\"\n4. **Word of mouth** — $1 entry price makes it easy to recommend\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Is the app live on the App Store right now, or still pending review?\n- What's the current download count?\n- Any user feedback yet?\n- What's the App Store listing look like? Screenshots, description optimized?\n- Any analytics/tracking in the app?\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Get first 15 paid downloads\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo in subscription revenue (~5,000 active subscribers at $1/mo)\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] Submit to App Store (if not already live)\n- [ ] Reddit marketing blitz — authentic posts in journaling/productivity subs\n- [ ] TikTok screen recording — show the app, the vibe, the \"quiet\" angle\n- [ ] App Store screenshot optimization\n- [ ] Week 1 metrics check — downloads, retention, any reviews\n- [ ] Set up basic analytics if not already in place\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n(none yet)\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] App built and ready\n- [x] Pricing model set ($1 upfront, 60-day grace, $1/mo)\n- [x] Brand positioning locked (\"quiet personal thoughts\")\n\n## Files\n\n*Located at: /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/ffeedd/*\n*FFEEDD-specific instructions: /Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/ffeedd/CLAUDE.md*\n",

    "content": "# JEFF — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nJEFF is the operating system for everything Dan builds. It's a Next.js web app deployed on **Vercel** (auto-deploys on every push to main), backed by **Supabase** for all persistent data. Plus a Claude Code slash command (/jeff) for conversational daily planning.\n\nThe philosophy: no scoring math, no rigid ranked lists. Show Dan the state of everything, let him pick. Priority is a story, not a formula.\n\n**Live URL:** assistant-k5go.vercel.app\n**Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Vercel > GitHub Pages for Next.js** — switched mid-session Feb 17. No more localhost crashes. Auto-deploys every push.\n- **Localhost dev server is unreliable** — crashes constantly, needs `lsof -i :3000 | xargs kill -9` to recover. Vercel made this irrelevant.\n- **Static export (`output: \"export\"`) works fine with Supabase** — all data is client-side fetched. No SSR needed for this use case.\n- **Supabase tables need manual SQL creation** — can't create via REST API with anon key. Run SQL in Supabase dashboard.\n- **Brain files are the soul of the system** — Claude reads/writes them between sessions, but Dan couldn't see them until the Brain page was built.\n- **Tags system is powerful** — JSONB tags on todos handle: focus, deadline, completed:DATE, archived. Flexible metadata without schema changes.\n- **dnd-kit closestCenter > closestCorners** — less finicky for 3-column layouts.\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Build JEFF into a usable daily tool — fully operational command center\n**12 months:** Replace Notion entirely as the single source of truth\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4\n- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), Lucide icons, Geist font\n- **State:** Zustand 5.0.11 (5 stores: todos, notes, transactions, columns, dreamwatch)\n- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — 6 tables: todos, notes, settings, transactions, kanban_columns, dreamwatch_pipeline\n- **Drag & Drop:** @dnd-kit/core 6.3.1\n- **Charts:** Recharts 2.15.4 (forecast, spending breakdown)\n- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub main branch)\n- **Repo:** github.com/tangochilesauce/assistant\n\n## What Exists (Feb 2026)\n\n### Pages\n| Route | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `/today` | Daily unified board — all

banner with countdown + progress bar\n- Deadline tags (only real hard-date items show in sidebar)\n- Focus items float to top of columns\n- Financial sidebar (debts, payments, income under deadlines)\n- Auto-archive completed items (status: 'archived', not deleted)\n- Notes per project (pin, edit inline, delete)\n- Brain file viewer per project (renders markdown brain files in app)\n- External link to Tango Dashboard (tangochilesauce.github.io/tango-dashboard/)\n\n### Sub-Projects\n- Tango → Amazon, Costco, UNFI, DTC\n- Each has its own brain file, notes page, and board\n\n###

The bottleneck is **traffic** — conversion rates are actually fine. PPC is barely running ($66 over 60 days) which is the single biggest untapped lever.\n\nTruffle is the star — 63% of revenue. Mango's 14.7% conversion is market-rate (solved mystery — not a problem).\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- **Traffic is the bottleneck**, not conversion — sessions are low, conversion is healthy\n- **PPC spend is negligible**: ~$33/mo (~$66 over 60 days) — barely a test, let alone a campaign\n- **Truffle = 63% of revenue** — the hero SKU, highest margin (70% on Amazon)\n- **Mango conversion (14.7%) is market-rate** — was a mystery, now solved. Not underperforming.\n- **Amazon margins by flavor**: Truffle 70% > Sriracha 63% > Mild 55% > Thai 54% > Hot 53%\n- SD-REMARKETING campaign should be paused (from schedule notes)\n\n## Key Metrics (Jan 2026)\n\n| Metric | Current | Target |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| Monthly revenue | $3,500 | $10,000 |\n| PPC spend | ~$33/mo | $300-600/mo |\n| Truffle % of revenue | 63% | Maintain |\n| Gap to close | $6,500/mo | — |\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe path from $3,500 → $10,000 is almost entirely PPC-driven:\n1. **Restart PPC at $10-20/day** — Sponsored Products on Truffle first (highest margin hero SKU)\n2. **Analyze search term report** — find which keywords convert, cut waste\n3. **Optimize Truffle listing** — title, bullets, A+ content for the best-converting SKU\n4. **Scale winners** — once ROAS is proven, increase budget\n5. **Add Sponsored Brands** — once SP is dialed in, brand-level campaigns for cross-selling\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What's the right PPC budget to test? $10/day? $20/day?\n- Which keywords to target for Truffle? Need search term report analysis\n- Should we run Sponsored Brands or just Sponsored Products first?\n- What's the current ACOS and ROAS on the tiny existing spend?\n- Are there any keyword rankings to protect/build on?\n- What seller fees are we actually paying? Need real number for margin calculation\n\n## Goal\n\n**This month:** Restart PPC campaigns, optimize Truffle listing, grow traffic\n**12 months:** $10,000/mo (25% of total revenue target)\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] Restart PPC campaigns — $10-20/day on Truffle Sponsored Products\n- [ ] Analyze search term report — find converting keywords\n- [ ] Truffle title + bullet optimization\n- [ ] Pause SD-REMARKETING campaign\n- [ ] Fix HOTT2 listing issue (from schedule)\n- [ ] Pull current ACOS/ROAS data\n- [ ] Review A+ content for all flavors\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n(none yet)\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Identified traffic as bottleneck (not conversion)\n- [x] Solved Mango conversion mystery (14.7% is market-rate)\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n**Amazon PPC Quick Reference:**\n- Start with Sponsored Products (easiest, most data)\n- Auto campaigns first to mine keywords, then manual campaigns to target winners\n- Target ACOS: 25-35% for hot sauce category\n- Truffle should be the lead SKU (highest margin = most room for ad spend)\n- Budget $10-20/day = $300-600/mo — still conservative but 10x current spend\n\n## Files\n\n*Located at: /Projects/🔥 tango/amazon/*\n- Listings, A+ content, flat files, FNSKU labels, PPC data, screenshots\n- 1,776 files total\n",

    "content": "# Tango x Costco — Brain\n\n**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month\n**Weight:** 15%\n\n---\n\n## My Current Understanding\n\n**UNBLOCKED.** Moses call happened Feb 4, 2026. He's in. Roadshows are happening.\n\nThe format has pivoted from the old 16oz 2-pack idea to a **3-pack of 8oz bottles (Hot + Sriracha + Truffle) at ~$19 retail.** This is smarter — no new bottle size to develop, uses our existing 8oz format, and the perceived value is insane (Truffle alone is $17 on Amazon).\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Moses assigns 5 Costco locations (mix of A/B/C stores)\n2. We demo our 3-4 best sellers across 5 stores in 5 days\n3. Target: $10,000 total sales revenue across the 5 days\n4. Ship 1 pallet per flavor per store ahead of demos\n5. Costco returns unsold product (consignment)\n6. After roadshow data, we discuss the \"club case\" — the permanent Costco offering\n\n**Timeline:** ~3 months from call (targeting May 2026)\n\n**The $10K target math:**\n- At $19/three-pack: 527 packs across 5 days = ~105/day\n- That's 1 sale every 3-4 minutes over an 8-hour demo day\n- Costco foot traffic is massive — doable but aggressive\n\n**Key insight from the call:** Moses initially said Dan picks 5 stores, then later said he'd assign an A store, 2 B stores, and 2 C stores. He's curating the locations — that's a good sign, he's thinking about this strategically.\n\n**Deck status (Feb 17):** We have a 3-slide roadshow proposal deck (Bootstrap HTML). Currently reworking the tone — less aggressive sales pitch, more collaborative proposal. Moses is already interested; we don't need to hard-sell. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Goals\n\n| Timeframe | Goal |\n|-----------|------|\n| **This Month** | Finalize 3-pack format, begin production planning for roadshow inventory |\n| **3 Months** | Execute 5-store roadshow, hit $10K sales target |\n| **12 Months** | Prove velocity → secure inline placement → $5K/month recurring |\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |\n| Roadshows/month | 0 | 2 | +2 |\n| Units/roadshow | 0 | 400 | +400 |\n| Inline placement | No | Yes | — |\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Name | Role | Email | Phone |\n|------|------|-------|-------|\n| **Moses Romero** | Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery | mosesromero@costco.com | 714-741-2208 |\n| David Liuzzi | Previous contact (moved desks) | dliuzzi@costco.com | 714-741-7787 |\n\n- Moses prefers **phone calls over email** — don't email, call\n\n---\n\n## 3-Pack Proposal\n\n### Product Format\n\n**Format:** 3 × 8oz squeeze bottles — Hot, Sriracha, Truffle\n**Retail price:** $19.00\n\n**Why this combo:**\n- **Hot** — OG best seller, always #1\n- **Sriracha** — Cheapest COGS ($2.74), clean Huy Fong alternative, massive category\n- **Truffle** — Premium differentiator, $17 standalone on Amazon, best TRUFF competitor on market\n- Sriracha and truffle are two of the most popular hot sauce flavors of all time — broad appeal in a Costco demo environment\n\n**Why $19 is genius:**\n- Truffle alone retails for $17 on Amazon\n- Customer gets 3 full-size bottles for $19 = insane perceived value\n- Trial machine — they taste 3 flavors, become repeat buyers across all channels\n\n### The Math\n\n| Component | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Hot COGS | $3.49 |\n| Sriracha COGS | $2.74 |\n| Truffle COGS | $3.34 |\n| 3-pack packaging (est.) | ~$0.75 |\n| **Total COGS per 3-pack** | **~$10.32** |\n\n| Line Item | Amount |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Retail price | $19.00 |\n| Costco's cut (~15%) | $2.85 |\n| **Tango receives** | **~$16.15** |\n| COGS | ~$10.32 |\n| **Gross profit per 3-pack** | **~$5.83** |\n| **Margin** | **~36%** |\n| Member value per bottle | $6.33 vs $9.99 retail (37% savings) |\n\n### Roadshow Revenue Scenario ($10K target)\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Target revenue | $10,000 |\n| 3-packs needed | ~527 |\n| Per day (5 days) | ~105/day |\n| Sales pace | 1 sale every 3-4 min |\n| Gross profit on $10K | ~$3,100 |\n\n### Inventory Exposure (5 stores)\n\n| Item | Quantity |\n|------|----------|\n| 3-packs to produce | ~1,250 |\n| Total bottles needed | ~3,750 |\n| Bottles per flavor | ~1,250 each (Hot, Sriracha, Truffle) |\n| COGS exposure | ~$12,900 |\n| **Risk mitigation** | **Costco returns unsold product** |\n\n### Recurring Revenue Path\n- $19/pack × 100 units/day × 4 days = $7,600/roadshow\n- 1 roadshow/month = ~$7,600\n- Inline placement = recurring without demo staffing\n\n---\n\n## Blockers\n\n| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |\n|---------------|-----|----------------|\n| 3-pack packaging design | Need to design sleeve/box for 3-pack | Source packaging options, get quotes |\n| Inventory production | Need ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) for 5 stores | Schedule cook + pack shifts with Aria |\n| Store assignments | Moses will assign A/B/C stores | Follow up with Moses closer to roadshow date |\n\n---\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- ✅ **Positive taste reviews from David's team** (Aug 2024)\n- ✅ **Roadshow → Inline path confirmed** — Prove velocity first\n- ✅ **Moses is IN** (Feb 4, 2026) — Roadshows approved, 5 stores in ~3 months\n- ✅ **$10K target across 5 days** — aggressive but doable at $19/3-pack (~105 packs/day)\n- ✅ **Moses curating store mix** — 1 A store, 2 B stores, 2 C stores (he's thinking strategically)\n- ✅ **Costco returns unsold product** — consignment model, inventory risk is manageable\n- ✅ **3-pack pivot is smarter than 16oz 2-pack** — no new bottle size, better margins, trial-focused\n- ✅ **Hot + Sriracha + Truffle is the killer combo** — OG + trending + premium, $10.32 COGS for $19 retail\n- ✅ **Roadshows precede the \"club case\"** — Moses wants sales data first, then decides permanent format\n- ✅ **Demo your 3-4 best sellers** — Moses said to bring top flavors for demos, club case discussion comes after\n- ✅ **Deck messaging insight (Feb 17):** Don't tell the buyer how his store works.

    "content": "# Tango DTC — Brain\n\n## Current Understanding\n\nDirect-to-consumer sales are currently $0. This is an untapped channel with real potential — we have an email list in Klaviyo, a Shopify store, and a domain that just need to be cleaned up and activated.\n\n**The Email Situation:** Dan previously used Klaviyo for email marketing, but deliverability tanked badly — most subscribers weren't seeing emails. Cancelled Klaviyo due to cost vs poor open rates. DNS was updated at that time but hasn't been checked in months. List is still in Klaviyo (account may be downgraded, not closed — need to verify).\n\n**Domain:** tangochilesauce.com. Email handled by IONOS. Shopify store exists.\n\n**14-Day Sprint Plan (Feb 14-28):** Clean DNS → export list → warm up with Shopify Email → drive first DTC sales.\n\n## What We've Learned\n\n- Klaviyo deliverability was destroyed — domain had stale Klaviyo DNS records left behind\n- **DNS audit (Feb 17, 2026):** DMARC is solid (p=quarantine, 100%, reports to postmaster@). SPF has STALE Klaviyo + SendGrid includes. DKIM has two stale Klaviyo signing keys still live. MX records are clean (IONOS).\n- Domain DNS was \"updated\" when Klaviyo cancelled but Klaviyo ghosts were left in — `include:klaviyo-mail.com` and `include:sendgrid.net` still in SPF, `kl._domainkey` and `kl2._domainkey` DKIM records still active\n- Email list is dormant — needs tiered re-engagement, NOT a blast to everyone\n- **Shopify Email is the play** — 10K free emails/mo, no branding, native Shopify integration, zero extra cost. Beats MailerLite (500 contact cap), Brevo (300/day limit), Mailchimp (250 contacts lol)\n- Klaviyo data retention: if account was downgraded (not fully closed), all data is still there. If fully closed, data is permanently deleted\n- Re-engagement math: expect 5-15% of dormant list to re-engage, 1-2% conversion on openers\n- First email should NOT be a sale — \"we're back\" personal note to generate positive signals\n\n## What We've Tried\n\n- Klaviyo for email marketing — cancelled due to poor deliverability + high cost (date unknown, months ago)\n- Updated domain DNS settings when Klaviyo was cancelled — but left stale Klaviyo records behind\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- ~~What domain is sending from?~~ **ANSWERED: tangochilesauce.com, IONOS mail**\n- ~~What's the current SPF/DKIM/DMARC status?~~ **ANSWERED: DMARC good, SPF/DKIM have stale Klaviyo refs**\n- ~~Is the Shopify store set up?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, exists**\n- ~~What email platform to use?~~ **ANSWERED: Shopify Email (10K free, native, no branding)**\n- What's the current email list size? How old is it? When was the last send?\n- Can Dan still log into Klaviyo to export the list?\n- Is anyone monitoring postmaster@tangochilesauce.com for DMARC reports?\n- DTC pricing strategy — same as Amazon? Higher? Bundle deals?\n- Social media following / other traffic sources to pair with email?\n\n## Short-Term Goal\n\n**This month (Feb 2026):** Clean DNS → export list from Klaviyo → warm up via Shopify Email → drive first direct sales\n\n## Long-Term Goal\n\n**12 months:** $5,000/mo DTC revenue stream\n\n## Pipeline\n\n### 📋 To Do\n- [ ] **Log into Klaviyo** — export full subscriber list as CSV (if account still accessible)\n- [ ] **Clean DNS in IONOS** — remove klaviyo-mail.com from SPF, remove sendgrid.net from SPF, delete kl._domainkey CNAME, delete kl2._domainkey CNAME\n- [ ] **Run domain health checks** — MXToolbox.com blacklist check, Sender Score, Google Postmaster Tools\n- [ ] **Verify exported list** — run through NeverBounce/ZeroBounce free tier, kill dead emails\n- [ ] **Set up Shopify Email** — Marketing section in Shopify admin, add Shopify SPF/DKIM to DNS\n- [ ] **Segment list into tiers** — Tier 1 (50-100 known/recent), Tier 2 (100-200 moderate), Tier 3 (rest)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 1** — \"We're Back\" personal note from Dan, no sale\n- [ ] **Send Tier 1** — monitor opens/bounces/complaints for 24hr\n- [ ] **Send Tier 2** — if Tier 1 clean\n- [ ] **Send Tier 3** — if Tier 2 clean\n- [ ] **Draft Email 2** — value content (recipe, brand story, behind the scenes)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 3** — THE OFFER (discount code / bundle / free shipping)\n- [ ] **Draft Email 4** — \"Last chance\" urgency\n- [ ] Redesign Tango website/Shopify store for DTC sales\n- [ ] Set up DTC pricing / promotions / bundles\n\n### 🔨 In Progress\n- [x] DNS audit — completed Feb 17, found stale Klaviyo records\n\n### ✅ Done\n- [x] Domain DNS audit (Feb 17) — identified stale SPF includes + DKIM keys\n- [x] Platform research — Shopify Email selected (10K free, native, no branding)\n- [x] Re-engagement strategy designed — 4-email tiered warmup over 14 days\n\n## Intel (Time-Sensitive)\n\n**Email Platform Free Tiers (Feb 2026):**\n| Platform | Free Emails/mo | Free Contacts | Branding? | Winner? |\n|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|---------|\n| Shopify Email | 10,000 | Unlimited | No watermark | ✅ YES |\n| MailerLite | 12,000 | 500 | Yes | Too small |\n| Brevo | ~9,000 (300/day) | 100,000 | Yes | Backup option |\n| Mailchimp | 500 | 250 | Yes | Avoid |\n| Klaviyo Free | 500 | 250 | Yes | Too small |\n\n**DNS Records to Clean (IONOS panel):**\n| Action | Record | What to Remove |\n|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:klaviyo-mail.com` |\n| Remove from SPF | TXT @ | `include:sendgrid.net` (if no active SendGrid use) |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl._domainkey | Points to kl.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n| Delete DKIM | CNAME kl2._domainkey | Points to kl2.domainkey.u161779.wl030.sendgrid.net |\n\n**Re-Engagement Timeline:**\n- Email 1 (Day 3): \"We're back\" — personal, no sale\n- Email 2 (Day 6-7): Value content — recipe/story\n- Email 3 (Day 10): THE OFFER — discount/bundle\n- Email 4 (Day 12-14): \"Last chance\" urgency\n\n**Expected Results (1,000 person list):**\n- ~150 re-engage (15%)\n- ~10 buy (7% of engaged)\n- ~$250 revenue from sprint\n- Real value: clean engaged list for long-term DTC channel\n\n## Files\n\n*Shopify store: [need URL]*\n*Klaviyo account: [need to check if accessible]*\n*Located at: /Projects/🔥 tango/website/ (if exists)*\n",
