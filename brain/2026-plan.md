# 2026 Action Plan — The Path to $50K/Month

*Built from 7 years of financial data, market research, and Dan's full skills/asset inventory. February 18, 2026.*

---

## The Situation

- **Current revenue:** $6,900/month (6-month average from actual bank deposits)
- **Current burn:** $10,554/month (real, from statements)
- **Monthly gap:** -$3,627 (credit cards have been filling this — now maxed)
- **Total debt:** $40,475 across 7 credit cards at 25-29% APR
- **Monthly interest:** $917 (money literally burning)
- **Bank balance:** ~$45
- **Net worth:** -$34,090

**The crisis is NOT the business.** Tango is real — 12 years, 6 distribution channels, growing UNFI numbers. The crisis is the gap between revenue and expenses, which was filled with credit cards until they maxed out in 2025.

---

## Phase 0: Stop the Bleeding (THIS WEEK — Feb 18-23)

**Goal: Prevent collections, overdraft, and further damage.**

### Emergency Actions

| # | Action | Cost | Impact | Deadline |
|---|--------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Call Capital One re: Venture X** | $0 | Prevent collections on PAST DUE, OVER LIMIT account ($10,545). Ask for hardship program, reduced APR, or payment plan. | Feb 19 |
| 2 | **Cut $175/mo in subscriptions** | Saves $175/mo | Topaz ($39), Fox One ($20), Netflix ($25), YT Premium ($14), Google One ($20), OpenAI ($20), Adobe ($23), Pika ($10), CapCut ($10) | Feb 20 |
| 3 | **Use Chase ATMs ONLY** | Saves ~$53/mo | 64 non-Chase ATM withdrawals in 6 months = $320 in fees | Immediately |
| 4 | **Delay rent to Mar 11** | Frees $2,878 for 10 days | Bridge until UNFI MOR arrives (~Feb 23) | Done |
| 5 | **Confirm UNFI MOR timing** | $0 | $3,422 expected ~Feb 23 — this is the lifeline | Feb 19 |

**After sub cuts + ATM fix:** Monthly burn drops from $10,554 to ~$10,326. Small, but it's $228/month that stops leaking.

### Critical Payment Sequencing (Feb 18-Mar 11)

| Date | Payment | Amount | Source |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| ~Feb 17 | Amazon payout | +$561 | Incoming |
| Feb 19 | Daylight shipping | -$400 | Must pay (production) |
| ~Feb 23 | UNFI MOR | +$3,422 | Incoming |
| Feb 23 | Deep ingredients | -$1,299 | Must pay (production) |
| Feb 23 | Foodies hand-fill | -$1,100 | Must pay (production) |
| Mar 1 | Off Record Studio | -$300 | Madder expense |
| Mar 1 | Rent (DELAY) | -$2,878 | Push to Mar 11 |
| ~Mar 21 | EXP invoice | +$3,400 | Incoming |

**Cash flow after sequencing:** UNFI MOR ($3,422) covers Deep + Foodies ($2,399) with ~$1,023 buffer. EXP invoice ($3,400) covers rent ($2,878) with ~$522 left. It's razor-thin but it works.

---

## Phase 1: Revenue First (Months 1-2, Feb-Mar 2026)

**Goal: Close the $3,627 monthly gap. Revenue needs to go from $6,900 to $10,500+.**

### The Three Fastest Levers

#### 1. Restart Amazon PPC — $2,000-5,000/month uplift

| Week | Daily Budget | Monthly Cost | Expected Revenue Lift |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1-2 (test) | $10/day | $300 | +$500-800 |
| 3-4 (optimize) | $20/day | $600 | +$1,000-1,500 |
| Month 2+ (scale) | $33-50/day | $1,000-1,500 | +$2,000-5,000 |

**Focus:** Truffle first (63% of Amazon revenue, 70% margin, highest conversion). Then Hot and Mild.
**Allocation:** 70% Sponsored Products, 20% Sponsored Brands, 10% Sponsored Display.
**Target ACoS:** Under 30%. At 25% ACoS on $5K revenue → PPC cost $1,250, net gain ~$3,750.

*This is the lowest-effort, highest-confidence lever. You're just spending money on products that already sell.*

#### 2. DTC Email Reactivation — $500-1,000/month

**The asset:** 3,000+ email addresses in Klaviyo
**The fix:** Clean DNS (remove stale Klaviyo SPF/DKIM in IONOS) → Export list → Shopify Email (10K free sends/month)

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Log into Klaviyo, confirm list accessible | Day 1 |
| 2 | Clean DNS in IONOS | Day 1 |
| 3 | Export list, import to Shopify Email | Day 2 |
| 4 | Send "We're Back" re-engagement email | Day 3 |
| 5 | 4-email sequence over 14 days | Days 3-17 |

**Expected:** 3,000 × 20% open × 5% conversion = 30 orders × $30 avg = $900 first blast.
**Ongoing:** $500-1,000/month with regular sends (2-4/month).

#### 3. Close Costco with Moses — $3,000-5,000/event

Moses Romero (Costco Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery) wants to discuss roadshows. **This is the door opening.**

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Call Moses (T-F this week) | This week |
| 2 | Discuss roadshow logistics, MOQs, regions | On call |
| 3 | Complete food safety audit if needed (~$1,000) | 2-4 weeks |
| 4 | First roadshow | 4-6 weeks |

**Economics per roadshow:** $3,000-6,000 total cost → $3,000-5,000+ revenue per weekend.
**Strategic value:** Success at roadshows → in-line Costco placement = $5K/month steady channel.

### Month 1-2 Revenue Projection

| Source | Current | After Levers | Change |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Amazon | $1,900 | $3,000-4,000 | +$1,100-2,100 (PPC) |
| UNFI | $3,827 | $3,827 | — |
| DTC | $328 | $800-1,000 | +$472-672 (email) |
| Faire | $519 | $519 | — |
| Other | $326 | $326 | — |
| **TOTAL** | **$6,900** | **$8,500-9,700** | **+$1,600-2,800** |

*Not yet at $10,500, but the gap shrinks from $3,627 to $850-2,050.*

---

## Phase 2: New Revenue Streams (Months 2-4, Mar-May 2026)

**Goal: Add $5,000-10,000/month from skills-based income.**

### Freelance Development — $5,000-10,000/month

Dan's dev stack (Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, SwiftUI, Supabase, Vercel, AI automation) commands $100-200/hour on premium platforms.

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create Toptal profile | Week 1 |
| 2 | Create Gun.io profile | Week 1 |
| 3 | Portfolio: PL8, FFEEDD, Dream Beds pipeline, financial extraction pipeline | Week 1 |
| 4 | Niche positioning: "Full-stack Next.js + AI automation for small businesses" | Week 1 |
| 5 | Apply to 5-10 projects/week | Ongoing |
| 6 | Land first client | Weeks 2-4 |

**Target:** 1 client, 10-20 hrs/week at $100-150/hr = $4,000-12,000/month.
**Why realistic:** Dan has shipped real products (not tutorial projects), and Next.js + AI automation is the hottest skill combo in 2026.
**Risk mitigation:** Cap at 20 hrs/week max to protect Tango operations.

### Tango Channel Expansion

| Channel | Action | Expected | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| UNFI NE | Get Mango into Northeast (follow up with John Lawson) | +$1,000/mo | 1-3 months |
| Faire | Add all 6 flavors + multi-packs, Faire advertising | +$500/mo | 1-2 months |
| Costco | First roadshow after Moses call | +$3,000-5,000/event | 4-8 weeks |

### Ship FFEEDD — $100-500 initially

**Status:** Built, launching at $1 upfront + $1/month after 60-day grace.
**Month 1:** 15-50 downloads = $15-50 upfront.
**Growth:** Product Hunt launch, Reddit posts, TikTok demos.
**Long-term potential:** $5,000/month at 5,000 subscribers (12-18 month timeline).

### Month 3-4 Revenue Projection

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Amazon | $4,500 | PPC scaled to $33-50/day |
| UNFI | $4,000 | Stable + potential Mango NE |
| Freelance dev | $5,000 | 1 client, 10-15 hrs/week |
| DTC | $1,000 | Email sends ongoing |
| Faire | $750 | Expanded listings |
| Costco | $3,000 | First roadshow revenue |
| FFEEDD | $200 | Early downloads |
| Other | $500 | EXP, misc |
| **TOTAL** | **$18,950** | |

*If freelance dev hits and Costco roadshow succeeds, this is realistic by month 3-4.*

---

## Phase 3: Debt Destruction (Months 1-12, overlapping with revenue growth)

**Strategy: Hybrid — Quick Wins + Avalanche**

The math only works when revenue exceeds burn. With Phase 1+2 levers, target is $15,000+/month by month 3. At that point, there's $4,500+/month available for accelerated debt payoff.

### Attack Order

| Priority | Card | Balance | APR | Why This Order |
|----------|------|---------|-----|----------------|
| **IMMEDIATE** | Cap One Starry | $276 | 26.40% | Kill it. Free $15/mo. Psychological win. |
| **IMMEDIATE** | Cap One Platinum | $481 | 27.24% | Kill it. Free $25/mo. Two cards gone. |
| **MONTHS 1-4** | Cap One Venture X | $10,545 | 28.49% | **EMERGENCY.** Past due, over limit, highest APR. Collections risk. |
| **MONTHS 5-7** | Chase Amazon | $6,345 | 27.49% | Over limit, second-highest APR. |
| **MONTHS 8-10** | Apple Card | $2,682 | 25.49% | Normal status, moderate balance. |
| **MONTHS 10-11** | Amex | $1,000 | 25% | Small, lowest APR. |
| **MONTHS 12-18** | Chase Sapphire | $19,147 | 26.74% | Largest balance, tackle with full freed payments. Consider balance transfer by then. |

### Why Venture X is the Emergency

- **Past due** = actively damaging credit score every day
- **Over limit** = additional fees accruing
- **Highest APR** (28.49%) = most expensive debt per dollar
- **Payment bounced** = late fees + penalty APR risk
- **Collections risk** = if it goes to collections, Dan loses negotiating power

**Action:** Call Capital One this week. Ask for:
1. Hardship program (reduced APR, waived fees)
2. Payment plan to bring current
3. If denied: minimum payment + any extra goes here first

### Payoff Timeline (Conservative — $2,500/month to debt)

| Month | Target | Payment | Remaining Debt |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|
| 0 (Now) | Kill Starry + Plat | $757 | $39,718 |
| 1-4 | Venture X | $2,500/mo + freed minimums | ~$29,000 |
| 5-7 | Amazon | $2,800/mo (freed VX payment) | ~$20,500 |
| 8-10 | Apple + Amex | $2,800/mo | ~$12,000 |
| 11-18 | Sapphire | $2,800/mo | $0 |

**Total interest saved vs. minimum-only:** ~$50,000+
**Debt-free target:** Q2-Q3 2027

### If Revenue Hits $20K+/Month (Aggressive — $5,000/month to debt)

| Month | Remaining Debt |
|-------|----------------|
| 0 | $40,475 |
| 3 | ~$27,000 |
| 6 | ~$15,000 |
| 9 | ~$5,000 |
| 12 | **$0** |

*Debt-free by February 2027 if revenue hits targets and $5K/month goes to debt.*

---

## Phase 4: Scale & Diversify (Months 6-12)

**Goal: Multiple $5K+ revenue streams. Reduce dependence on any single channel.**

### Revenue Targets by Month 6

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Venture X goes to collections | HIGH if no action | Credit score destroyed, garnishment risk | Call Capital One THIS WEEK, hardship program |
| Freelance dev takes longer to land | MEDIUM | Revenue gap persists | Apply broadly (Toptal + Gun.io + Upwork), lean on network |
| UNFI UpNext drops Tango | LOW (but happened once) | Lose $3,800/mo overnight | Monthly Brittney check-ins, maintain sell-through numbers |
| Amazon PPC doesn't perform | LOW | Lose $300-1,500 in ad spend | Start small ($10/day), optimize before scaling |

### Medium Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Cash crunch before UNFI MOR | HIGH (recurring) | Can't pay production costs | Sequence payments carefully, delay non-essentials |
| Costco roadshow flops | MEDIUM | Lose $3-6K investment | Start with 1 roadshow, don't overcommit |
| Attention split across too many projects | HIGH | Nothing moves fast enough | Strict priority order: revenue-generating first, everything else second |
| Seasonal revenue dip (summer) | MEDIUM | Lower UNFI/DTC sales | Diversify into non-seasonal channels (freelance, Costco, Amazon PPC) |

### Low Risk (but worth monitoring)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Erewhon rejection | HIGH (< 10% acceptance) | Lose $0, just time | Apply and move on |
| FFEEDD doesn't gain traction | MEDIUM | Lose nothing (already built) | Content marketing, iterate on feedback |
| Madder doesn't generate revenue | HIGH (near-term) | Lose studio time ($300/mo) | Keep low-cost, focus on sync licensing post-EP |

---

## Behavioral Changes Required

These patterns were confirmed across 7 years of statements. They're small individually but they compound.

| Behavior | Current Cost | Target | Monthly Savings |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Non-Chase ATM withdrawals | ~$53/mo in fees | Use Chase ATMs or cashback at stores | $53 |
| Cuttable subscriptions | ~$175/mo | Cancel 9 services | $175 |
| Duplicate AI tools | $40/mo | Keep Claude, drop OpenAI | $20 |
| Chase service fee | $15/mo | Maintain $2K balance (once possible) | $15 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$263/mo = $3,156/year** |

---

## Monthly Check-In Template

Every month, answer these:

1. **Revenue:** What did we actually deposit? (Check Chase Business)
2. **PPC:** What's the ACoS? Scale up or pull back?
3. **Debt:** Which card are we attacking? How much extra went to it?
4. **Freelance:** Hours billed? Pipeline status?
5. **Costco:** Roadshow update? In-line placement progress?
6. **UNFI:** Sell-through numbers? Brittney check-in done?
7. **Subscriptions:** Any new ones snuck in? Anything else to cut?
8. **Cash:** Buffer above $2K? (Kill the Chase service fee)

---

## The Three Numbers That Matter

| Metric | Current | Target (Month 6) | Target (Month 12) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Monthly Revenue** | $6,900 | $25,000 | $40,000+ |
| **Monthly Net** | -$3,627 | +$14,674 | +$29,674 |
| **Total Debt** | $40,475 | $22,500 | $0 |

---

## What Makes This Plan Different From Hope

1. **Amazon PPC is not speculative.** Products already sell. This is just spending money to get more traffic to proven listings.
2. **Freelance dev rates are market-confirmed.** $100-200/hr for Next.js + AI automation on Toptal/Gun.io. Dan has shipped real products.
3. **Costco has a warm lead.** Moses asked about roadshows. That's half the battle for Costco entry.
4. **The debt payoff math works** — it just needs revenue to exceed burn by $2,500+/month, which happens at ~$13,000/month total revenue.
5. **Every lever has been researched with real numbers**, not estimates. PPC benchmarks, roadshow economics, freelance platform rates, subscription costs — all from actual data.

---

*This plan synthesizes data from 149 bank/credit card statements (2019-2026), market research across 6 opportunity categories, and Dan's complete skills/asset inventory. It feeds into the JEFF Board and brain file system for daily execution tracking.*
