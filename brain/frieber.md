# Frieber.com — Brain File

## My Current Understanding

Dan's personal site. Currently hosted on Cargo (paying $14-19/mo for something that should be free). Goal is to cancel Cargo, migrate DNS to Vercel (already used for PL8), and build a real personal site. Placeholder goes up first.

Dan is a product builder, entrepreneur, hot sauce founder (Tango), musician (Madder), app creator (FFEEDD), and creative technologist. The site should reflect all of that — not a generic portfolio, but something with personality.

## What We've Learned

- Cargo costs $14/mo (yearly) or $19/mo (monthly) — ~$168-228/year for static hosting
- Vercel is free for personal projects, supports custom domains, auto-deploys from GitHub
- Dan already has Vercel set up for PL8 (assistant-k5go.vercel.app)
- Domain: frieber.com (already owned, currently pointed at Cargo)

## What We've Tried

- (nothing yet — fresh project as of Feb 24, 2026)

## Open Questions

- Where is frieber.com registered? (need to know for DNS changes)
- What's on the current Cargo site? Anything worth preserving?
- What does Dan want the real site to be? Portfolio? Landing page? Blog?
- What content/copy does Dan want on the placeholder?

## Short-Term Goal

Cancel Cargo, deploy placeholder on Vercel, stop bleeding $14-19/mo.

## Long-Term Goal

Build a real personal site that ties together all of Dan's projects and serves as an SEO hub (per the master revenue table in CLAUDE.md).
