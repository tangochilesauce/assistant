## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Real Product + Real Revenue
Not a pitch deck. Not a prototype. 12 years of CPG operations, real customers, real shelf space. $6,900/month from multiple channels.

### 2. Cold-Fill Certification Moat
Tango's production is cold-fill (no heat treatment). This is a significant barrier — most co-packers can't do it. It's why the product tastes better than competitors and why the margins work.

### 3. Buyer Relationships
Moses at Costco, Brittney at UNFI, John at WF, Lauren at Erewhon. These relationships took years to build. You can't buy them or build them quickly.

### 4. Full-Stack Tech Skills
Can build his own tools (PL8, FFEEDD, Tango Dashboard, Dream Beds pipeline, financial extraction). No need to hire developers. This is a massive cost advantage for a solo operator.

### 5. Multi-Channel Distribution
Amazon + UNFI + Faire + Mable + EXP + DTC. If one channel dips, others compensate. Most small CPG brands have 1-2 channels.

### 6. Production Infrastructure
Existing relationship with Foodies Mfg, ingredient suppliers (Deep, My Orchard), packaging vendors. Can produce on demand.

## Constraints

### Critical (Must Address)
| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **$40K credit card debt at 25-29% APR** | $946/month in interest alone, 2 cards over limit, payments bouncing | Revenue increase + expense cuts + possible balance transfer |
| **~$45 in bank** | One auto-payment from overdraft, no emergency buffer | UNFI MOR (~Feb 23) is the lifeline |
| **$2,878/month rent** | Largest single expense, 42% of revenue goes to rent | Not easily reducible in LA — need income to grow past it |

### Structural
| Constraint | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Solo operator** | Can't scale beyond personal capacity; every project competes for attention |
| **Attention split (5+ active projects)** | None get full focus. Madder + Dream Beds + FFEEDD collectively generate $0 but consume time |
| **LA cost of living** | Rent, gas, food all premium. $8K/month is bare survival |
| **Broken wrist (Jan 2026)** | Can't play guitar physically; limits Madder to production/mixing |

### Behavioral Patterns (from 7 years of data)
| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Cash withdrawal habit | 12+ non-Chase ATM withdrawals/month, ~$600/month in cash + $60 in fees |
| Smoke shop spending | $100-200/month consistent across years |
| Subscription creep | $500+/month across 20+ services, many redundant |
| Revenue volatility | Months range from $2K to $27K — no buffer to smooth |
| Credit card spiral | 2025: went from $0 CC debt to $40K in 12 months |

## The Story in Numbers

### Revenue Arc (7 Years)
| Year | Revenue | Story |
|------|---------|-------|
| 2019 | $117K | Brooklyn peak — DTC + UNFI + wholesale |
| 2020 | $68K | COVID + Brooklyn→LA transition |
| 2021 | $62K | LA rebuild, finding new channels |
| 2022 | $211K | **PEAK** — big wholesale orders + growth |
| 2023 | $154K | Normalization |
| 2024 | $87K | Declining, channels shifting |
| 2025 | $76K | Growth in UNFI SoPac but overall down |

### What Happened in 2025
Revenue declined from 2022's peak while expenses didn't. The gap was filled with credit cards. By January 2026: 7 maxed cards, $40K in debt, $946/month in interest, 2 accounts in past-due/over-limit status.

### The Path Forward
The business is viable. $6,900/month is real revenue with proven growth levers. The crisis is cash management, not business model. Double revenue to $14K/month and cut $200/month in expenses → stable. Triple revenue to $20K/month → debt payoff in 18-24 months.
