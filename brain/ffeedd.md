# FFEEDD — Brain

## Current Understanding

FFEEDD is an iOS journaling app for quiet personal reflection. It launched with a **$1 upfront + 60-day grace period + $1/mo subscription** model. Currently monitoring initial downloads and user feedback.

The app is live. Now it's about getting it in front of people.

## What We've Learned

- **"Quiet personal thoughts"** is the core positioning — intimate, private, no social pressure
- Pricing model: $1 upfront filters for quality users, 60-day grace gives them time to build the habit, $1/mo is low enough to not cause churn
- App is built and submitted — the hard part (building) is done, now it's marketing
- Has its own CLAUDE.md with FFEEDD-specific instructions at `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/ffeedd/CLAUDE.md`

## Brand / Messaging

- **Core tagline:** "Quiet personal thoughts" — use for App Store subtitle, marketing materials, landing page hero
- **Positioning:** Private journaling, no social features, no sharing, no followers. Just you and your thoughts.
- **Tone:** Calm, understated, intimate. The anti-social-media journal.

## Strategy

1. **App Store optimization** — subtitle uses "quiet personal thoughts," screenshots show the calm UI
2. **Reddit marketing blitz** — r/journaling, r/mentalhealth, r/productivity, r/iosapps. Authentic posts, not ads.
3. **TikTok screen recordings** — show the app in use, the clean UI, the privacy angle. "This is where I write things I don't post."
4. **Word of mouth** — $1 entry price makes it easy to recommend

## Open Questions

- Is the app live on the App Store right now, or still pending review?
- What's the current download count?
- Any user feedback yet?
- What's the App Store listing look like? Screenshots, description optimized?
- Any analytics/tracking in the app?

## Goal

**This month:** Get first 15 paid downloads
**12 months:** $5,000/mo in subscription revenue (~5,000 active subscribers at $1/mo)
