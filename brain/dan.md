## Who Dan Is

Born 1985, Morristown NJ. Jewish American father (Prudential corporate), Honduran immigrant mother (arrived ~3 years before marriage). Chaotic early childhood — moved constantly around NY/NJ, parents struggling with money and relationship. Landed in Bedminster around age 6, brother born, started school.

**The entrepreneurial DNA is inherited from both sides.** Dad hated his corporate job, both parents dreamed of self-employment, mom eventually started her own home decorating/curtains business. Dad told 10-year-old Dan to hang leaflets and hustle lawn watering — Dan got 5 calls immediately. Has been self-employed in spirit ever since.

Now 40, lives alone in a 2BR in LA. Good dual-monitor setup. Has been alone for ~3 years since a breakup, describes it as being "dropped here by fate" to learn about himself. This is a turning point moment — pressure from debt, back taxes, and Tango cash flow has forced a reckoning.

**Bilingual:** English native, Spanish fluent (not perfect). Manages Tango's entire 7-person production team in Spanish — zero English speakers. Can take professional calls in Spanish.

## The Arc

### Childhood & Early Hustles (1985-2003)
- Lawn watering, babysitting, side hustles from age 10
- Computer club kid in early 90s, natural with technology
- **HTML in 6th grade** (~1997) — fell in love with coding and design immediately
- Built websites including "Daily-Junk" (photos of high school kids) — went locally viral before Facebook existed
- Started making websites for businesses as a teenager
- Bass guitar obsession began in early high school (RHCP, Sublime, Rancid)
- Worked at local snowboard shop
- Co-founded the snowboard club at Bernards High School — literally went to the township and made it happen
- "Most Humorous" at K-8 school
- Weed at 15, at the music studio recording first band's EP
- **Founded The Greenlight Group at age 16 (2001)** — a design/development agency serving local businesses in Somerset County, NJ. Grew to 3 employees and 25+ active clients. **Sold the business** when he left for college.
- By end of high school: local legend on bass, prolific web designer, serial hustler, had already started and sold a business

### Rutgers & Art School (2003-2009)
- Started at Rutgers with no direction
- **Lead Designer at Rutgers Dean's Office** (Oct 2004 - May 2006) — led a team of designers. Got this while still a student.
- **Apple Store — Creative Genius/Personal Trainer** (Apr 2005 - Mar 2008, 3 years) — taught advanced creative software (Aperture, Logic) in private sessions and public classes in the store theatre. Was there when the iPhone launched.
- Decided to leave Rutgers unless he could study art → applied to **Mason Gross School of the Arts** → accepted
- **BFA in Art (Graphic Design)** from Mason Gross — formalized graphic design training, took existing skill to next level
- Learned: design, branding, video, claymation, silkscreening, book binding, photography, darkroom, blogging, sculpture, painting, illustration, animation
- **The rock star years** — had a successful touring band in college, packed 200-person house shows, "the main rock star in the coolest band"
- Lived in 6+ houses with beautiful creative people
- After band broke up, moved into psychedelic house, traveled to festivals across the country
- Deep formative experience with community, creativity, and counterculture

### NYC Era (2009-2020)
- Highland Park NJ for a year (first time alone), got arrested for playing music with windows open while smoking a joint. 3 months probation — only time he's quit weed for more than 2 weeks since age 15.
- **Creative Director, Priority Support** (Sep 2008 - Sep 2011, 3 years) — led art direction for IT/creative agency in NYC. Clients: Sherman's Travels, Traffiq, Pandora.com.
- **Freelance Designer/Web Developer, MTV/Viacom** (Jun 2011 - Apr 2013, ~2 years) — designed and developed for NextMovie, Film.com, and other subsidiaries. Work seen daily by massive audience.
- **Book Designer for Renate Aller** (Dec 2011 - Oct 2012) — designed a limited-edition hand-bound accordion art book, published by Radius Books, foreword by Dr. David Anfam.
- **Freelance Designer, MKG** (2012) — Evian water campaign and 2012 rebrand.
- **Freelance Web Developer, C42D Creative** (Jan 2013 - Oct 2013) — built responsive UIs and apps for Reebok, Smart Tap, Maverick's Lacrosse, Crabtree & Evelyn.
- **Contracted Web Developer, Facebook** (May 2013 - Aug 2013) — responsive HTML+CSS web/mobile templates for high-traffic environments.
- **UX Designer, RAPP** (Nov 2013 - Jan 2014) — UX and information architecture for Time Warner Cable.
- Also did work for Equinox, Evian, Cleanmarket, and many more. Mostly direct client work.
- Met Eric in Williamsburg, did 2-3 big client gigs (Eric developed, Dan designed). Eric was magnetic but not productive — partnership was short.
- **Built Hyper** — social media app. Reddit meets Instagram: public photos posted to interest boards, ranked by popularity. 10,000 users, Cosmopolitan press, $250K offer in Israel. Failed because team couldn't develop fast enough to iterate on the spark. (Pre-AI — exactly the kind of thing Dan can now build with Claude Code.)
- Got Tango into **Smorgasburg** (OG Brooklyn waterfront location)
- **Tango Presents**: 50+ paid concerts across Brooklyn. Dan handled everything — booking venues, booking talent, promotion, equipment, photography. Full event production solo.
- **Warehouse parties** (5 total, 100-400 people each) — full-scale event production with partner Gof. Music, Tango tacos, graffiti, costumes, rooftop, the works. Handled promotion, security, parking, bartending, sponsors — everything from scratch.
- **Tango Chile Sauce born** — started as beloved product among friends, grew into a real brand
- Got Tango into **Whole Foods**
- Product placement on **HBO's High Maintenance** and **Master of None**
- Lived in a Brooklyn house with 7 creative guys all making music and building things
- Became known as "the hot sauce entrepreneur from Brooklyn"

### LA Era (2020-Present)
- Moved to LA with girlfriend during Covid. Broke up ~2022.
- Alone in LA for 3 years — deep self-discovery period
- Moved Tango manufacturing to West Coast during Covid
- Introduced new flavors, grew accounts, got a $100K order
- Dove deeper into audio production and beat making
- **2025: AI revolution.** Started using Claude Code and AI tools. Unleashed creativity.
- **In 3 months built:**
  - FFEEDD — a polished iOS app
  - PL8 — full business organization platform (includes orders/production dashboard)
  - Dream Beds — fully automated YouTube channel
- Now: in debt, owes back taxes, borrowing from mom to fund Tango batches. Needs income diversification urgently.

## Skills

### Tier 1 — Master Level (decades, revenue-generating)

### Tier 3 — Emerging Superpower
| Skill | Evidence | Market Value |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **AI-Directed Product Development** | Uses Claude Code as creative development partner. Designs every pixel, architects systems, breaks complex flows into buildable pieces. Shipped 4 real products in 3 months. This is creative direction + systems thinking + design taste → AI execution. Not "prompting" — product development with AI as the tool. | Emerging — rare combo of design sense + AI execution |

### Important Context
Dan is a **designer**, not a developer. He never learned to code traditionally. Through AI tools (Claude Code), he ships production software — PL8 and FFEEDD are both real, functioning products. He doesn't know how good the code is under the hood, and couldn't debug a codebase manually or take a traditional freelance dev contract. What he CAN do is design and build complete products from concept to shipped.

### Tools
| Tool | Level |
|------|-------|
| Photoshop | Expert |
| Illustrator | Expert |
| Procreate | Expert |
| CapCut | Expert |
| Ableton Live | Professional |
| FL Studio | Professional |
| Claude Code | Daily driver, primary dev tool |
| HTML/CSS | Hand-code, expert |
| Shopify Liquid | Professional (with reference) |
| WordPress | Professional (with reference) |

## How Dan Works

**In flow:** Detail work. Design. Music. Can get lost in the details of almost anything visual or sonic. Obsesses over kerning, color values, pixel-perfect layouts AND big-picture brand world-building, story, visual systems. Both micro and macro.

**With clients:** Good at it. Hates it. Can manage feedback loops, revisions, scope — but it drains him.

**With AI:** This is the unlock. Dan's workflow is:
1. See the whole system/product in his head
2. Break it into logical flows and pieces
3. Design every visual detail himself
4. Use Claude Code as his development team to execute
5. Iterate in conversation for weeks until every pixel is right

This is not prompting. This is a **creative director running an AI studio.**

**Work capacity:** Can put in 10+ hours on a focused day. Dual monitor setup. Good enough internet.

## What Dan Wants

### The Identity Shift
Dan has been an **underground artist** his entire life — incredible body of work, 1000 Instagram followers. He's done hiding. He wants:
- A polished online presence he's proud of
- Professional IG bio, accurate LinkedIn, real website
- To be visible and recognized for what he's actually built
- To stop being the best-kept secret

### The Money Reality
- **Dream since 25:** Automatic/passive income. Originally thought Tango would be the vehicle — produce once, collect forever. Reality: CPG is far more hands-on than expected.
- **If money wasn't a factor:** Music production all day + designing fun products/things
- **Real goal:** Monthly passive income from digital products (apps, YouTube, etc.)
- **FFEEDD and Dream Beds are the dream projects** — they align with what he actually wants, not just what pays bills
- **Tango is the engine** — real revenue and the difficulty is his moat, but the goal is to systematize it so it runs with minimal touch
- **Short-term:** Diversified income streams beyond Tango
- **Long-term:** "Creative mastermind" positioning. High-value work at the intersection of design, brand, and AI-directed product development.

### The Naval Alignment
Dan identifies deeply with Naval Ravikant's thesis: in the AI era, the highest-value people are multi-dimensional creatives with taste, vision, and judgment who use AI as leverage. Dan is proof of concept — a designer/artist/entrepreneur who ships real products with AI. This is the direction he wants to build toward.

### What He Doesn't Want
- Public speaking (can do it, but rough)
- To be pigeonholed as one thing
- To go back to being invisible
- Corporate bullshit

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Real Product + Real Revenue** — Not a pitch deck. 12 years of CPG operations, real customers, real shelf space. $6,900/month from multiple channels.
2. **Cold-Fill Certification Moat** — Tango's production is cold-fill (no heat treatment). Most co-packers can't do it. Better taste, workable margins.
3. **Buyer Relationships** — Moses at Costco, Brittney at UNFI, John at WF, Lauren at Erewhon. Years to build, can't be bought.
4. **Full-Stack Tech Skills** — Builds his own tools (PL8, FFEEDD, Dream Beds pipeline). No need to hire developers. Massive cost advantage for a solo operator.
5. **Multi-Channel Distribution** — Amazon + UNFI + Faire + Mable + EXP + DTC. If one channel dips, others compensate.
6. **Production Infrastructure** — Existing relationship with Foodies Mfg, ingredient suppliers (Deep, My Orchard), packaging vendors. Can produce on demand.

## Financials & Constraints

### The Story in Numbers (7 Years)
| Year | Revenue | Story |
|------|---------|-------|
| 2019 | $117K | Brooklyn peak — DTC + UNFI + wholesale |
| 2020 | $68K | COVID + Brooklyn→LA transition |
| 2021 | $62K | LA rebuild, finding new channels |
| 2022 | $211K | **PEAK** — big wholesale orders + growth |
| 2023 | $154K | Normalization |
| 2024 | $87K | Declining, channels shifting |
| 2025 | $76K | Growth in UNFI SoPac but overall down |

### Critical Constraints
| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **$40K credit card debt at 25-29% APR** | $946/month in interest alone, 2 cards over limit | Revenue increase + expense cuts + possible balance transfer |
| **~$45 in bank** | One auto-payment from overdraft, no emergency buffer | UNFI MOR (~Feb 23) is the lifeline |
| **$2,878/month rent** | Largest single expense, 42% of revenue goes to rent | Need income to grow past it |

### Structural Constraints
| Constraint | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Solo operator** | Can't scale beyond personal capacity; every project competes for attention |
| **Attention split (5+ active projects)** | None get full focus. Dream projects generate $0 but consume time |
| **LA cost of living** | Rent, gas, food all premium. $8K/month is bare survival |
| **Broken wrist (Jan 2026)** | Can't play guitar physically; limits Madder to production/mixing |

### Behavioral Patterns (from 7 years of data)
| Pattern | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Cash withdrawal habit | 12+ non-Chase ATM withdrawals/month, ~$600/month in cash + $60 in fees |
| Smoke shop spending | $100-200/month consistent across years |
| Subscription creep | $500+/month across 20+ services, many redundant |
| Revenue volatility | Months range from $2K to $27K — no buffer to smooth |
| Credit card spiral | 2025: went from $0 CC debt to $40K in 12 months |

### The Path Forward
The business is viable. $6,900/month is real revenue with proven growth levers. The crisis is cash management, not business model. Double revenue to $14K/month and cut $200/month in expenses → stable. Triple revenue to $20K/month → debt payoff in 18-24 months.

## Key Insight

Dan's whole life has been a pattern: see something, learn it fast, go deep, build something real, move on to the next thing. The thread connecting everything — websites, bands, events, Tango, apps — is **creative vision executed through whatever tools are available.** The tools changed (HTML → Photoshop → bass guitar → Shopify → Claude Code) but the pattern never did. He's always been the person who sees the whole picture and makes it real.

Now the tool is AI, and for the first time, one tool can match his range.
