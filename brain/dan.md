## Who Dan Is

Born 1985, Morristown NJ. Jewish American father (Prudential corporate), Honduran immigrant mother (arrived ~3 years before marriage). Chaotic early childhood — moved constantly around NY/NJ, parents struggling with money and relationship. Landed in Bedminster around age 6, brother born, started school.

**The entrepreneurial DNA is inherited from both sides.** Dad hated his corporate job, both parents dreamed of self-employment, mom eventually started her own home decorating/curtains business. Dad told 10-year-old Dan to hang leaflets and hustle lawn watering — Dan got 5 calls immediately. Has been self-employed in spirit ever since.

Now 40, lives alone in a 2BR in LA. Good dual-monitor setup. Has been alone for ~3 years since a breakup, describes it as being "dropped here by fate" to learn about himself. This is a turning point moment — pressure from debt, back taxes, and Tango cash flow has forced a reckoning.

**Bilingual:** English native, Spanish fluent (not perfect). Manages Tango's entire 7-person production team in Spanish — zero English speakers. Can take professional calls in Spanish.

## The Arc

### Childhood & Early Hustles (1985-2003)
- Lawn watering, babysitting, side hustles from age 10
- Computer club kid in early 90s, natural with technology
- **HTML in 6th grade** (~1997) — fell in love with coding and design immediately
- Built websites including "Daily-Junk" (photos of high school kids) — went locally viral before Facebook existed
- Started making websites for businesses as a teenager
- Bass guitar obsession began in early high school (RHCP, Sublime, Rancid)
- Worked at local snowboard shop
- Co-founded the snowboard club at Bernards High School — literally went to the township and made it happen
- "Most Humorous" at K-8 school
- Weed at 15, at the music studio recording first band's EP
- **Founded The Greenlight Group at age 16 (2001)** — a design/development agency serving local businesses in Somerset County, NJ. Grew to 3 employees and 25+ active clients. **Sold the business** when he left for college.
- By end of high school: local legend on bass, prolific web designer, serial hustler, had already started and sold a business

### Rutgers & Art School (2003-2009)
- Started at Rutgers with no direction
- **Lead Designer at Rutgers Dean's Office** (Oct 2004 - May 2006) — led a team of designers. Got this while still a student.
- **Apple Store — Creative Genius/Personal Trainer** (Apr 2005 - Mar 2008, 3 years) — taught advanced creative software (Aperture, Logic) in private sessions and public classes in the store theatre. Was there when the iPhone launched.
- Decided to leave Rutgers unless he could study art → applied to **Mason Gross School of the Arts** → accepted
- **BFA in Art (Graphic Design)** from Mason Gross — formalized graphic design training, took existing skill to next level
- Learned: design, branding, video, claymation, silkscreening, book binding, photography, darkroom, blogging, sculpture, painting, illustration, animation
- **The rock star years** — had a successful touring band in college, packed 200-person house shows, "the main rock star in the coolest band"
- Lived in 6+ houses with beautiful creative people
- After band broke up, moved into psychedelic house, traveled to festivals across the country
- Deep formative experience with community, creativity, and counterculture

### NYC Era (2009-2020)
- Highland Park NJ for a year (first time alone), got arrested for playing music with windows open while smoking a joint. 3 months probation — only time he's quit weed for more than 2 weeks since age 15.
- **Creative Director, Priority Support** (Sep 2008 - Sep 2011, 3 years) — led art direction for IT/creative agency in NYC. Clients: Sherman's Travels, Traffiq, Pandora.com.
- **Freelance Designer/Web Developer, MTV/Viacom** (Jun 2011 - Apr 2013, ~2 years) — designed and developed for NextMovie, Film.com, and other subsidiaries. Work seen daily by massive audience.
- **Book Designer for Renate Aller** (Dec 2011 - Oct 2012) — designed a limited-edition hand-bound accordion art book, published by Radius Books, foreword by Dr. David Anfam.
- **Freelance Designer, MKG** (2012) — Evian water campaign and 2012 rebrand.
- **Freelance Web Developer, C42D Creative** (Jan 2013 - Oct 2013) — built responsive UIs and apps for Reebok, Smart Tap, Maverick's Lacrosse, Crabtree & Evelyn.
- **Contracted Web Developer, Facebook** (May 2013 - Aug 2013) — responsive HTML+CSS web/mobile templates for high-traffic environments.
- **UX Designer, RAPP** (Nov 2013 - Jan 2014) — UX and information architecture for Time Warner Cable.
- Also did work for Equinox, Evian, Cleanmarket, and many more. Mostly direct client work.
- Met Eric in Williamsburg, did 2-3 big client gigs (Eric developed, Dan designed). Eric was magnetic but not productive — partnership was short.
- **Built Hyper** (see below) — the social media app. Walked away from $250K to focus on Tango.
- **Warehouse parties** (5 total, 100-400 people each) — full-scale event production with partner Gof. Music, Tango tacos, graffiti, costumes, rooftop, the works. Handled promotion, security, parking, bartending, sponsors — everything from scratch.
- **Tango Chile Sauce born** — started as beloved product among friends, grew into a real brand
- Got Tango into **Smorgasburg** (OG Brooklyn waterfront location)
- **Tango Presents**: 50+ paid concerts across Brooklyn. Dan handled everything — booking venues, booking talent, promotion, equipment, photography. Full event production solo.
- **Hyper** — Dan's social media app. Reddit meets Instagram: public photos posted to interest boards, ranked by popularity. 10,000 users, Cosmopolitan press, $250K offer in Israel. Failed because team couldn't develop fast enough to iterate on the spark. (Pre-AI — this is exactly the kind of thing Dan can now build with Claude Code.)
- Got Tango into **Whole Foods**
- Product placement on **HBO's High Maintenance** and **Master of None**
- Lived in a Brooklyn house with 7 creative guys all making music and building things
- Became known as "the hot sauce entrepreneur from Brooklyn"

### LA Era (2020-Present)
- Moved to LA with girlfriend during Covid. Broke up ~2022.
- Alone in LA for 3 years — deep self-discovery period
- Moved Tango manufacturing to West Coast during Covid
- Introduced new flavors, grew accounts, got a $100K order
- Dove deeper into audio production and beat making
- **2025: AI revolution.** Started using Claude Code and AI tools. Unleashed creativity.
- **In 3 months built:**
  - FFEEDD — a polished iOS app
  - PL8 — full business organization platform (includes orders/production dashboard)
  - Dream Beds — fully automated YouTube channel
- Now: in debt, owes back taxes, borrowing from mom to fund Tango batches. Needs income diversification urgently.

## How Dan Works

**In flow:** Detail work. Design. Music. Can get lost in the details of almost anything visual or sonic. Obsesses over kerning, color values, pixel-perfect layouts AND big-picture brand world-building, story, visual systems. Both micro and macro.

**With clients:** Good at it. Hates it. Can manage feedback loops, revisions, scope — but it drains him.

**With AI:** This is the unlock. Dan's workflow is:
1. See the whole system/product in his head
2. Break it into logical flows and pieces
3. Design every visual detail himself
4. Use Claude Code as his development team to execute
5. Iterate in conversation for weeks until every pixel is right

This is not prompting. This is a **creative director running an AI studio.**

**Work capacity:** Can put in 10+ hours on a focused day. Dual monitor setup. Good enough internet.

## What Dan Wants

### The Identity Shift
Dan has been an **underground artist** his entire life — incredible body of work, 1000 Instagram followers. He's done hiding. He wants:
- A polished online presence he's proud of
- Professional IG bio, accurate LinkedIn, real website
- To be visible and recognized for what he's actually built
- To stop being the best-kept secret

### The Money Reality
- **Immediate:** $500 this week. Any gig.
- **Short-term:** Diversified income streams beyond Tango
- **Long-term:** "Creative mastermind" positioning. High-value work at the intersection of design, brand, and AI-directed product development.

### The Naval Alignment
Dan identifies deeply with Naval Ravikant's thesis: in the AI era, the highest-value people are multi-dimensional creatives with taste, vision, and judgment who use AI as leverage. Dan is proof of concept — a designer/artist/entrepreneur who ships real products with AI. This is the direction he wants to build toward.

### What He Doesn't Want
- Public speaking (can do it, but rough)
- To be pigeonholed as one thing
- To go back to being invisible
- Corporate bullshit

---

## Current Situation (Feb 2026)

- **Debt:** Serious. Owes back taxes. Borrowing from mom for Tango production batches.
- **Income:** ~$6,900/mo from Tango (Amazon + UNFI) but costs eat most of it
- **Freelance presence:** Zero. No platforms, no portfolio site, out of the freelance game for 10+ years
- **Portfolio assets:** Tango (complete brand), FFEEDD, Dream Beds, Madder, plus years of logo/design work — but nothing organized for presentation
- **Network:** Not really available for quick referrals. Been focused on Tango.

---

## Online Presence (Feb 2026)

### LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/danfrieber)
- **Headline:** "The bridge between your organization and AI."
- **About:** AI-focused — talks about systems-level thinking, building, not just planning. Good direction but cut off / incomplete.
- **Experience:** 12 positions listed, well-documented. Tango + Frieber.com as current. All major client work listed.
- **Connections:** 383

### frieber.com (Cargo Collective)

- Presents as graphic designer/branding specialist.
- Has Tango and other work across year pages (I need to actually look through all pages).

### Instagram
- ~1000 followers. Underground artist aesthetic. Needs bio rewrite and strategic posting.

## Key Insight

Dan's whole life has been a pattern: see something, learn it fast, go deep, build something real, move on to the next thing. The thread connecting everything — websites, bands, events, Tango, apps — is **creative vision executed through whatever tools are available.** The tools changed (HTML → Photoshop → bass guitar → Shopify → Claude Code) but the pattern never did. He's always been the person who sees the whole picture and makes it real.

Now the tool is AI, and for the first time, one tool can match his range.
