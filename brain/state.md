# JEFF State — Last Updated Feb 18, 2026 (Session 4)

This is the boot-up file. Read this first every session.

## What Happened This Session

### Big Wins
- **Full financial excavation complete** — 149 bank/credit card statements (7 years) extracted, parsed, categorized, and analyzed
- **11,069 transactions** across all accounts processed into structured data
- **7 analysis reports generated** — debt snapshot, recurring payments, cash flow, income trends, seasonal patterns, money leaks, full financial picture
- **Dan's profile built** — Skills inventory, project inventory, network map, competitive advantages, constraints — all from data
- **10 revenue opportunities researched** — Amazon PPC, freelance dev, Costco roadshows, DTC email, UNFI expansion, FFEEDD, CPG consulting, Erewhon, Faire/Mable, sync licensing
- **2026 Action Plan written** — 4-phase plan with debt payoff strategy, revenue ramp projections, risk assessment

### Key Discoveries
- **Real monthly revenue: $6,900** (not $12,144 as previously estimated — that included double-counting and irregular income)
- **Real monthly burn: $10,554** (including $2,139 in CC minimums and $917 in interest)
- **Monthly gap: -$3,627** — credit cards filled this in 2025, now maxed
- **2025 debt explosion: $0 → $40,475** in 12 months (Sapphire alone: $394 → $19,147)
- **$175/month in cuttable subscriptions** identified (Topaz, Fox One, Netflix, YT Premium, Google One, OpenAI, Adobe, Pika, CapCut)
- **$53/month in ATM fees** from non-Chase withdrawals (64 withdrawals in 6 months)
- **Venture X is PAST DUE** — collections risk, must call Capital One immediately

## 2026 Plan (Summary)

**Phase 0 (THIS WEEK):** Stop the bleeding — call Capital One re: VX, cut $175/mo subs, Chase ATMs only, sequence payments around UNFI MOR
**Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Revenue first — restart Amazon PPC ($10-50/day ramp), DTC email reactivation (3,000 list), close Costco with Moses
**Phase 2 (Months 2-4):** New streams — land 1 freelance dev client ($5-10K/mo), ship FFEEDD, expand UNFI NE (Mango)
**Phase 3 (Months 1-12):** Debt destruction — kill Starry/Plat immediately, then avalanche VX → Amazon → Apple → Amex → Sapphire
**Phase 4 (Months 6-12):** Scale — CPG consulting, Erewhon, backburner products, sync licensing

**Revenue target:** $6,900 → $17,000 (Month 3) → $25,000 (Month 6) → $40,000 (Month 12)
**Debt-free target:** Q2-Q3 2027 (conservative) or Feb 2027 (aggressive)
