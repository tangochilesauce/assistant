## Detailed Breakdowns

### 1. Amazon PPC Restart (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Current state:** ~$66 spent over 60 days = basically nothing.
**Benchmarks (Grocery/Gourmet category):**
- Average CPC: $1.04
- Average ACoS: 30.2%
- Average conversion: ~10%
- Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue, best margins (70%)

**Recommended budget ramp:**
| Phase | Daily Budget | Monthly | Expected Revenue Lift |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| Week 1-2 (test) | $10/day | $300 | +$500-800 |
| Week 3-4 (optimize) | $20/day | $600 | +$1,000-1,500 |
| Month 2+ (scale) | $33-50/day | $1,000-1,500 | +$2,000-5,000 |

**Budget allocation:**
- Sponsored Products: 70% (best ROI for food)
- Sponsored Brands: 20%
- Sponsored Display: 10%

**Focus:** Truffle first (highest margin, highest conversion), then Hot and Mild.

**Target ACoS:** Under 30%. At 25% ACoS on $5K revenue, PPC cost = $1,250 → net gain ~$3,750.

### 2. Freelance Dev Client (FASTEST NEW REVENUE)

**Dan's dev stack:** Next.js 16, React, TypeScript, SwiftUI, Supabase, Vercel, AI automation
**Market rates:**
- Toptal/Gun.io: $100-200/hr for senior Next.js devs
- Upwork: $50-150/hr (median $63)
- Next.js specialists command 15-35% premium over general React

**Path to first client:**
1. Create Toptal/Gun.io profile (1 day)
2. Portfolio: PL8 app, FFEEDD, Tango Dashboard, financial extraction pipeline
3. Niche: "Full-stack Next.js + AI automation for small businesses"
4. Target: 10-20 hrs/week at $100-150/hr = $4,000-12,000/month

**Why this is realistic:**
- Dan has shipped real products (not tutorial projects)
- Next.js 16 + AI automation is the hottest skill combo in 2026
- 10 hrs/week is sustainable alongside Tango

**Risk:** Time competition with Tango work. Mitigation: take 1 client, 10-20 hrs/week max.

### 3. Costco Roadshows

**Economics (from research):**
- Vendor fee: $35/day (4-day event)
- Food safety audit: ~$1,000 (one-time)
- 14% Costco markup on consignment
- Foot traffic: 16,000-20,000 members per weekend
- Minimum sales to qualify for more: $3,000/SKU/warehouse/weekend

**True cost per roadshow:**
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Vendor fees (4 days) | $140 |
| Product (samples + consignment) | $1,500-3,000 |
| Shipping | $500-1,000 |
| Staff (Dan + 1 helper, 4 days) | $1,000-2,000 |
| **Total** | **$3,000-6,000** |

**Revenue potential:** $3,000-5,000+ per weekend if product demos well.
**Strategic value:** Success at roadshows → in-line Costco placement = the $5K/month channel.

**Moses Romero wants to discuss roadshows.** This is the door opening.

---

### 4. DTC Email Reactivation

**The asset:** 3,000+ email addresses from Klaviyo
**The blocker:** Stale DNS records, Klaviyo account status uncertain
**The fix:** Clean DNS → export list → Shopify Email (10K free sends/month)

**Expected results:**
- 3,000 list × 20% open rate × 5% conversion = 30 orders
- Average order value ~$30 = $900 first blast
- Ongoing monthly: $500-1,000 with regular sends

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to set up and send first campaign.

---

### 5. UNFI Mango NE Expansion

**The data:**
- SoPac (with Mango): +516% YoY
- Northeast (no Mango): -9% YoY
- Mango adds ~7 units/week net at WF

**The blocker:** John Lawson response
**The math:** Adding Mango to NE = ~$1,000/month additional UNFI revenue
**Effort:** Follow up with John, submit paperwork, wait.

---

### 6. FFEEDD Launch

**Status:** Built, launching at $10 upfront
**Realistic month 1:** 15-50 downloads = $105-$350
**Growth path:** Product Hunt, Reddit, TikTok → thousands of downloads
**Long-term:** $1/month subscription × 5,000 subscribers = $5K/mo (12-18 month timeline)

---

### 7. CPG Consulting (NEW REVENUE STREAM)

**Dan's unique knowledge:**
- 12 years CPG operations
- UNFI vendor (knows the process end-to-end)
- Whole Foods placement experience
- Amazon FBA for food products
- Cold-fill manufacturing knowledge
- Costco buyer relationship

**Market rates for CPG consultants:**
- Retainer: $1,000-3,000/month per client
- Commission: 3-5% of sales generated
- Brokers charge $1,000-$15,000/month depending on scope

**Path:**
1. Position as "helping emerging food brands get into UNFI/Whole Foods/Amazon"
2. 1-2 clients at $2,000/month = $2,000-4,000/month
3. Leverage existing relationships and knowledge
4. Find clients through food/CPG communities, LinkedIn, Faire vendor network

**Why this works:** Dan has the exact knowledge that emerging brands pay thousands per month for. He's literally living the playbook.

### 8. Erewhon Placement

**Process:**
1. Contact buyer (Lauren Martinez = warm lead from 2022)
2. Submit via vendor portal (dashboard.erewhonmarket.com)
3. Send samples via FedEx
4. Bi-weekly tastings by Erewhon team
5. <10% acceptance rate

**Requirements:**
- Non-GMO, USDA Organic preferred (check Tango's certifications)
- Luxury packaging (may need label upgrade)
- Reliable distribution capability
- Strong brand "feel"

**Revenue potential:** Premium pricing at Erewhon = higher margins. Estimate $2,000/month at 2-3 stores initially.

**Timeline:** 3-6 months from submission to shelf.

---

### 9. Faire/Mable Growth

**Current:** ~$500/month from Faire
**Growth levers:**
- More product listings (all 6 flavors + multi-packs)
- Faire marketplace advertising
- Seasonal promotions
- Better product photography

**Potential:** $1,000-2,000/month with active management.

---

### 10. Music Sync Licensing (Madder — Future)

**Fee ranges for independent artists:**
| Placement | Fee |
|-----------|-----|
| YouTube/micro-sync | $5-500 |
| Indie film | $500-2,000 |
| Cable TV episode | $500-5,000 |
| Streaming (Netflix) | $500-5,000 |
| National ad | $10,000-50,000 |

**Platforms to register:** Musicbed, Artlist, Music Gateway, Sync Songwriter
**Timeline:** After Madder EP drops (3/3), register tracks on sync platforms. Volume of licensable tracks matters — need 10-20+ songs.

## Revenue Ramp Projection

### Conservative Scenario (Focus on top 3 levers)

| Month | Amazon PPC | Freelance Dev | Costco | Other | Total |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Current | $1,900 | $0 | $0 | $5,000 | $6,900 |
| Month 1 | $2,500 | $3,000 | $0 | $5,200 | $10,700 |
| Month 2 | $3,500 | $5,000 | $3,000 | $5,500 | $17,000 |
| Month 3 | $4,500 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $6,000 | $20,500 |
| Month 6 | $6,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $7,000 | $23,000 |
| Month 12 | $10,000 | $5,000 | $5,000 | $10,000 | $30,000 |

### What Makes This Realistic
1. Amazon PPC: Just spending money on proven products. Not speculative.
2. Freelance dev: Market rate for Dan's skills is $100-150/hr. 10 hrs/week = $5K-7.5K/month.
3. Costco: Moses is the buyer and he's interested. That's half the battle.
4. UNFI/Faire/DTC: Incremental growth on existing channels.

### What Could Accelerate It
- FFEEDD viral moment → sudden $5K+ month
- Costco in-line placement (post-roadshow success) → $5K+/month steady
- 2nd freelance dev client → $10K+/month
- Erewhon placement → premium pricing lift
