# Life Admin — Brain

## Current Understanding

Non-revenue tasks that can't be ignored. These float above weighted project tasks when urgent. Life admin is about keeping the lights on so the revenue work can happen.

Balance is extremely tight (~$45 as of Feb 17). Monthly income exceeds expenses but cash flow timing matters — need to delay and sequence payments carefully.

## What We've Learned

- **Cash flow is tight but net positive** — income exceeds expenses, but timing of payments vs receipts creates pressure
- Rent can be delayed to Mar 11 (gives breathing room)
- Deep payment ($1,299) is a production cost but hits cash flow hard
- Off Record studio ($300) is a Madder expense due Mar 1
