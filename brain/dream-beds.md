# Dream Beds — Brain

**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month
**Weight:** 5%
**Channel:** https://www.youtube.com/@dream_beds

## My Current Understanding

Dream Beds is a YouTube channel creating AI-generated "impossible sanctuary" bedrooms — underwater domes, cloud bedrooms, bioluminescent caves. 3-hour sleep/relaxation videos.

**Status:** Automation workflow is BUILT. 5 videos live (66 views, 100% like ratio). Performance tracking system added. Now it's about consistent production + learning from data.

**The key insight:** Position as WELLNESS (not "ambient music") for 8x higher CPM ($10.92 vs $1.36).

**The math to $5K:** At $10.92 RPM, need ~458K views/month. More realistic path: 50K subs + sponsorships from mattress brands ($500-5K/video).

**Current milestone:** Hit 1K subs + 4K watch hours for monetization eligibility.

**The brand:** "Resting sanctuaries at the edge of vastness" — sometimes cosmic, sometimes urban, always infinite-feeling. Different places where humans rest at the edge of eternity. That's not content. That's a thesis.

## Video Performance (Jan 24, 2026)

| # | Title | Views | Like% | Scene | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Luxury Penthouse High Above City | **25** | 0% | Urban | Best reach |
| 2 | Ancient Palace (Egyptian) | **23** | 4.3% | Ancient | Fastest mover |
| 3 | Overgrown Hideaway | 10 | 10% | Overgrown | Moderate |
| 4 | Saturn Orbital Suite | 7 | **28.6%** | Celestial | Best engagement |
| 5 | Japanese Mountain Temple | 2 | 0% | Ancient | Underperforming |

### Patterns
- **Ancient/Egyptian themes WORK** — Palace is fastest mover
- **Urban/city vibes have reach** — Penthouse leading total views
- **Celestial has best engagement** — Saturn fans more engaged
- **Japanese/zen underperforming** — May need different angle
- **Recommendation:** Double down on Ancient (Egyptian style) and test more Celestial

## What We've Learned

### Confirmed
- **"Impossible Sanctuaries" brand position** — Bedrooms in places that couldn't exist in reality
- **Underwater/aquatic is the niche** — Lowest competition, highest wellness CPM
- **Wellness positioning = 8x CPM** — $10.92 RPM vs $1.36 for generic ambient
- **3-hour format is optimal** — Not intimidating (vs 8-10hr), good ad inventory (70+ mid-rolls)
- **Automation pipeline works** — MidJourney → Topaz Astra → FFmpeg loop → YouTube API upload
- **Topaz Astra is the tool** — 16x slow-mo + upscale done manually in desktop app (not API)
- **No Bloom needed** — MidJourney source images work as thumbnails (just compress <2MB)
- **NEVER use browser for YouTube** — Always YouTube Data API for uploads, scheduling, updates
- **API scope needed:** `youtube` (full access), not just `youtube.upload`

### Animation Constraints
Current MidJourney video + slow-mo workflow **cannot handle:**
- Moving water (waves, rain, waterfalls, bubbling jacuzzis)
- Swimming fish / sea creatures
- Active flames (roaring fires)
- Any realistic fluid dynamics

**Safe elements:** Flickering candle glow, ambient lighting, floating particles, fabric sway, drifting clouds, twinkling stars, subtle steam/mist, slow bioluminescent pulses.

### Topaz Labs API
- **API Key stored:** `scripts/credentials/topaz_api_key.txt`
- **Script:** `scripts/topaz_slowmo.py`
- **Plan:** 400 credits/month @ $39.99/mo
- **Cost per video:** 4 credits for 8x slowmo + 1080p upscale
- **Budget:** ~100 videos/month
- **Apollo model (apo-8):** Best quality slowmo, maxes at 8x per pass
- **Gaia model (gcg-5):** Best for AI-generated content upscaling
- **Processing time:** ~1.5 minutes per 5-second video
- **Note:** "10 free credits" on signup are for web app only, NOT API

## Automation Pipeline

### The Atomic Formula
```
VISUAL SEED → TIME MULTIPLICATION → AUDIO LAYER → MONETIZABLE LENGTH
(30 sec)         (16x slow-mo)        (ambient)       (3 hours)
```
**The magic:** 30 seconds of AI content → 3 hours of watchable video = **360x content multiplication**.

### Full Pipeline
```
Dan (manual):
  MidJourney → Generate source image
       ↓
  MidJourney Video → 30-second AI video
       ↓
  Topaz Astra (desktop app) → 16x slow-mo + upscale + frame interpolation
       ↓
  Drop .mp4 + .jpg/.png into /_ queue/

Claude (/dreamtime):
  dream_beds_video_maker.sh → Reverse + loop to 3 hours + add audio
       ↓
  compress_thumbnail.sh → Compress MidJourney image <2MB (no Bloom)
       ↓
  Claude → Generate title/description/tags from thumbnail
       ↓
  youtube_upload.py → Upload with metadata (PUBLIC)
```

### System Architecture
- **Queue path:** `/Users/danfrieber/⚡ claudio/dream-beds/_ queue/`
- **Sync daemon:** `dreamwatch_sync.py`
- **Dreamwatch page in PL8:** `/dreamwatch` — real-time pipeline status (polls Supabase every 5s)
- **Supabase table:** `dreamwatch_pipeline`
- **Pipeline states:** STEP0_META → STEP1 → ... → PUBLISHED
- **Card statuses:** ACTIVE, QUEUED, PUBLISHED, FAILED, UNPAIRED_VIDEO, UNPAIRED_THUMB

### Active Scripts
- `dream_beds_video_maker.sh` — video looping
- `compress_thumbnail.sh` — thumbnail compression
- `youtube_upload.py` — API upload with metadata
- `youtube_metrics.py` — pull fresh channel stats

### Manual Commands
```bash
./dream_beds_video_maker.sh source.mp4      # Just make the video
./compress_thumbnail.sh thumbnail.png        # Just compress thumbnail
./youtube_upload.py --video final.mp4 --metadata metadata.json --thumbnail thumb.jpg --privacy unlisted
python3 dream-beds/scripts/youtube_metrics.py --all   # Pull metrics
```

## The Core Concept (LOCKED)

> A human-scale, deeply comfortable resting place suspended at the edge of vast outer space.

Not "space bedroom." Not "sci-fi luxury." This is:
- **Rest + infinity**
- **Vulnerability + protection**
- **Sleep + cosmic scale**

### Two Non-Negotiable Anchors

**Anchor 1: Cosmic Exterior** — Outer space, visible planets/stars/nebulae, massive scale, slow eternal feeling.

**Anchor 2: Human Comfort Zone** — Bed, mattress, cushions, blankets, soft fabrics, low posture, safety/warmth/intimacy.

Everything else is just **architecture skins**.

### Expanded Concept
Infinity doesn't have to be stars. A megacity at night IS infinity to the nervous system.

**Two lanes:**
- **Lane A — Cosmic Sanctuaries:** Orbiting beds, cathedral-in-space, floating cloud temples
- **Lane B — Liminal Urban Sanctuaries:** High-rise bedrooms, neon balconies, rain-soaked megacity overlooks

Both share: rest, night, vastness, quiet. That's a brand, not a contradiction.

### Core Rules
- Always a **resting posture** (bed, mattress, cushions)
- Always **night or low light**
- Always **warm foreground / cool distance**
- Always **no people**
- Always **a sense of looking out at something larger than you**

## Prompt Framework (4 Layers)

### Layer 1: WORLD FOUNDATION (always paste)
```
A serene, hyper-real environment where a human-scale resting place exists at the edge of outer space.
Massive cosmic scale contrasted with intimate comfort.
No chaos, no urgency, timeless, sacred calm.
The viewer feels protected while gazing into infinity.
```

### Layer 2: COMFORT ANCHOR (always paste)
```
Foreground features a deeply comfortable resting setup: a bed or mattress with soft blankets, pillows, flowing fabric, warm textures.
Low, grounded posture designed for rest, sleep, contemplation.
Warm interior lighting, candlelight or soft ambient glow.
```

### Layer 3: COSMIC ANCHOR (always paste)
```
Beyond the resting space is open outer space: visible planets, star fields, nebulae, or glowing atmospheric curvature.
Vast scale, slow celestial presence, silent infinity.
Cool cosmic light contrasts gently with the warm interior glow.
```

### Layer 4: ARCHITECTURAL SKIN (swap this)

**Miami Vice Balcony:** Pastel tones, smooth curves, glass railings, coastal luxury aesthetics. Open-air balcony floating in space.

**Roman Cathedral:** Grand arches, carved stone, gold inlays, flowing drapery. Sacred, monastic luxury suspended in space.

**Victorian Castle Balcony:** Ornate stonework, iron railings, candle lanterns, gothic elegance. A quiet balcony overlooking the cosmos.

**Outdoor Camping:** Minimalist natural setting, grassy hill, blankets laid out beneath the stars. The ground itself floats gently in space.

### Camera + Style Control (every time)
```
Cinematic wide-angle composition. Symmetrical or gently balanced framing.
Soft depth, no distortion. Hyper-real, physically plausible materials.
Dreamlike but grounded realism.
```

### Negative Prompt (mandatory)
```
people, human faces, movement, action, text, logos, clutter, futuristic UI, cyberpunk chaos,
oversaturation, cartoon style, anime, sharp angles, harsh lighting, noise, blur, fisheye distortion
```

### Tuning Tips
1. **Reduce perfection** — add "slightly imperfect," "lived-in," "gentle asymmetry"
2. **Add liminal cue** — faint stars in glass, city lights blending into sky, atmospheric haze
3. **Lower status signal** — fewer glossy highlights, softer materials, "private refuge" not "penthouse flex"
