# Tango x Faire — Brain

**Target:** TBD | **Current:** TBD | **Gap:** TBD
**Weight:** Part of Tango umbrella
**Platform:** Faire.com (B2B wholesale marketplace)

## My Current Understanding

B2B wholesale through Faire marketplace. Retailers discover and order Tango through Faire's platform. Need baseline audit to understand current volume and strategy.

**Faire basics:**
- Wholesale marketplace connecting brands with independent retailers
- Faire handles payments, offers net-60 terms to retailers
- Faire takes ~25% commission (but handles risk)
- Free returns for retailers on first orders
- Strong discovery/search algorithm
- Tango link: https://www.faire.com/brand/b_4ruezpily0

- Reorder rate?
- Which SKUs sell best on Faire?
- Are we running any Faire ads/promotions?
