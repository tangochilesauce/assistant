# Tango Costco — Brain

## Current Understanding

Moses Romero (Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery) gave good feedback on samples. He wants to discuss roadshows. Call scheduled T-F this week. This is the most exciting lead right now — Costco could be transformative for volume.

Currently at $0 revenue. Target: $5,000/mo.

## What We've Learned

- Moses prefers **phone calls over email** — don't email, call
- He's an Assistant Buyer in D13 (Dry Grocery) — this is the right department for hot sauce
- He responded positively to samples — a win given how hard it is to get Costco attention
- Roadshows are the typical entry point for new brands at Costco — prove sell-through before shelf placement
- Costco margins are tight but volume makes up for it

## Key Contact

- **Moses Romero** — Asst Buyer, D13 Dry Grocery, Costco
- Status: ✅ GOOD FEEDBACK — wants roadshows
- Prefers: Phone calls (not email)
- Next step: Call T-F this week
- Contact info: (check distribution/costco/ folder for details)

## Open Questions

- What's the roadshow timeline? When can we start?
- What pricing works for Costco's margin requirements?
- How many units per roadshow? What's the production commitment?
- Which region first? (SoPac makes sense given UNFI success there)
- Multi-pack or single bottle for Costco format?
- What does the roadshow staffing look like? Dan has to be there?
- What's the demo/sampling logistics?

## Strategy

1. **Close the call with Moses** — confirm roadshow interest, get timeline
2. **Prepare roadshow pricing deck** — unit economics, proposed pricing, margin math
3. **Plan production** — roadshows require upfront inventory commitment
4. **Target SoPac region first** — already have UNFI momentum in LA
5. **Prove sell-through** → conversion to permanent shelf placement

## Goal

**This month:** Close roadshow deal with Moses
**12 months:** $5,000/mo through Costco (15% of total target)
