# Tango x Costco — Brain

**Target:** $5,000/month | **Current:** $0/month | **Gap:** $5,000/month
**Weight:** 15%

## My Current Understanding

**UNBLOCKED.** Moses call happened Feb 4, 2026. He's in. Roadshows are happening.

The format has pivoted from the old 16oz 2-pack idea to a **3-pack of 8oz bottles (Hot + Sriracha + Truffle) at ~$19 retail.** This is smarter — no new bottle size to develop, uses our existing 8oz format, and the perceived value is insane (Truffle alone is $17 on Amazon).

**How it works:**
1. Moses assigns 5 Costco locations (mix of A/B/C stores)
2. We demo our 3-4 best sellers across 5 stores in 5 days
3. Target: $10,000 total sales revenue across the 5 days
4. Ship 1 pallet per flavor per store ahead of demos
5. Costco returns unsold product (consignment)
6. After roadshow data, we discuss the "club case" — the permanent Costco offering

**Timeline:** ~3 months from call (targeting May 2026)

**The $10K target math:**
- At $19/three-pack: 527 packs across 5 days = ~105/day
- That's 1 sale every 3-4 minutes over an 8-hour demo day
- Costco foot traffic is massive — doable but aggressive

**Key insight from the call:** Moses initially said Dan picks 5 stores, then later said he'd assign an A store, 2 B stores, and 2 C stores. He's curating the locations — that's a good sign, he's thinking about this strategically.

**Deck status (Feb 17):** We have a 3-slide roadshow proposal deck (Bootstrap HTML). Currently reworking the tone — less aggressive sales pitch, more collaborative proposal. Moses is already interested; we don't need to hard-sell. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions.

## 3-Pack Proposal

### Product Format

**Format:** 3 × 8oz squeeze bottles — Hot, Sriracha, Truffle
**Retail price:** $19.00

**Why this combo:**
- **Hot** — OG best seller, always #1
- **Sriracha** — Cheapest COGS ($2.74), clean Huy Fong alternative, massive category
- **Truffle** — Premium differentiator, $17 standalone on Amazon, best TRUFF competitor on market
- Sriracha and truffle are two of the most popular hot sauce flavors of all time — broad appeal in a Costco demo environment

**Why $19 is genius:**
- Truffle alone retails for $17 on Amazon
- Customer gets 3 full-size bottles for $19 = insane perceived value
- Trial machine — they taste 3 flavors, become repeat buyers across all channels

### The Math

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Hot COGS | $3.49 |
| Sriracha COGS | $2.74 |
| Truffle COGS | $3.34 |
| 3-pack packaging (est.) | ~$0.75 |
| **Total COGS per 3-pack** | **~$10.32** |

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Retail price | $19.00 |
| Costco's cut (~15%) | $2.85 |
| **Tango receives** | **~$16.15** |
| COGS | ~$10.32 |
| **Gross profit per 3-pack** | **~$5.83** |
| **Margin** | **~36%** |
| Member value per bottle | $6.33 vs $9.99 retail (37% savings) |

### Roadshow Revenue Scenario ($10K target)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target revenue | $10,000 |
| 3-packs needed | ~527 |
| Per day (5 days) | ~105/day |
| Sales pace | 1 sale every 3-4 min |
| Gross profit on $10K | ~$3,100 |

### Inventory Exposure (5 stores)

| Item | Quantity |
|------|----------|
| 3-packs to produce | ~1,250 |
| Total bottles needed | ~3,750 |
| Bottles per flavor | ~1,250 each (Hot, Sriracha, Truffle) |
| COGS exposure | ~$12,900 |
| **Risk mitigation** | **Costco returns unsold product** |

### Recurring Revenue Path
- $19/pack × 100 units/day × 4 days = $7,600/roadshow
- 1 roadshow/month = ~$7,600
- Inline placement = recurring without demo staffing

## Blockers

| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |
|---------------|-----|----------------|
| 3-pack packaging design | Need to design sleeve/box for 3-pack | Source packaging options, get quotes |
| Inventory production | Need ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) for 5 stores | Schedule cook + pack shifts with Aria |
| Store assignments | Moses will assign A/B/C stores | Follow up with Moses closer to roadshow date |

---

## What We've Learned

- ✅ **Positive taste reviews from David's team** (Aug 2024)
- ✅ **Roadshow → Inline path confirmed** — Prove velocity first
- ✅ **Moses is IN** (Feb 4, 2026) — Roadshows approved, 5 stores in ~3 months
- ✅ **$10K target across 5 days** — aggressive but doable at $19/3-pack (~105 packs/day)
- ✅ **Moses curating store mix** — 1 A store, 2 B stores, 2 C stores (he's thinking strategically)
- ✅ **Costco returns unsold product** — consignment model, inventory risk is manageable
- ✅ **3-pack pivot is smarter than 16oz 2-pack** — no new bottle size, better margins, trial-focused
- ✅ **Hot + Sriracha + Truffle is the killer combo** — OG + trending + premium, $10.32 COGS for $19 retail
- ✅ **Roadshows precede the "club case"** — Moses wants sales data first, then decides permanent format
- ✅ **Demo your 3-4 best sellers** — Moses said to bring top flavors for demos, club case discussion comes after
- ✅ **Deck messaging insight (Feb 17):** Don't tell the buyer how his store works. Present the format, show the math, let him draw conclusions. "Proposed format" energy, not "here's why we're right" energy.

## Open Questions

- What does the 3-pack packaging look like? Sleeve? Box? Shrink wrap?
- Exact Costco margin — is it really 14-15% or does it vary?
- Which 5 stores will Moses assign? (He said he'll pick A/B/C mix)
- Staffing: Can we hire demo staff or does Dan need to be there all 5 days?
- What sampling supplies does Costco provide vs. what do we bring?
- Do we demo individual bottles or the 3-pack itself?
- What's the lead time from Moses confirming stores to demo dates?
- Production capacity: Can Aria handle ~3,750 bottles (1,250 each of Hot/Sriracha/Truffle) on top of regular UNFI/Amazon orders?
- Should we bring all 6 flavors for sampling even if the 3-pack is Hot/Sriracha/Truffle?
- What does Moses need from us to finalize? Pricing sheet? Product specs?
