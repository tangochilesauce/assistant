# Tango x Amazon — Brain

**Target:** $10,000/month | **Current:** $3,500/month | **Gap:** $6,500
**Weight:** 25%

---

## My Current Understanding

Amazon is Tango's biggest revenue driver. Truffle dominates (63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion). Traffic is the bottleneck, not conversion.

**Status:** PPC audit complete Feb 12. SRIRACHA AUTO is the #1 campaign (21x ROAS). SD-REMARKETING burning $42/mo for nothing — pause it. Coupons audited — Truffle S&S is a 9:1 winner, renew before Feb 15. Variation family still needs Seller Support call (HOTT2 won't attach).

## Goals

| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| **This Month** | Get to $10K/month ASAP |
| **12 Months** | Achieve maximum revenue in 2026 |

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Monthly Revenue | $3,500 | $10,000 | $6,500 |
| Truffle % of Revenue | 63% | Maintain | --- |
| Truffle Conversion | 38.7% | 40%+ | +1.3% |
| PPC ROAS | Varies | 5x+ | --- |

## What's Working

- **SRIRACHA AUTO** — 21x ROAS, $43.96 sales on $2.06 spend. #1 campaign.
- **TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE** — 3x ROAS, competitor targeting on TRUFF's listing works
- **TT-AUTO-CLOSE** — 24x ROAS (small sample but auto close-match is converting)
- **TT-AUTO-SUBS** — 7x ROAS (auto substitutes also converting)
- **Truffle S&S coupon** — 9:1 return ($210 sales / $23 cost)
- **Truffle dominates** — 63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion
- **Auto campaigns > Manual** — lower CPCs, better ROAS across the board

## Jan 30 Bid Overhaul — COMPLETED

**Root cause found:** Bids were $0.45-$0.55 while Amazon suggested $1.25-$3.38. Post-holiday search volume dropped + competition adjusted = we stopped winning auctions.

### Key Bid Changes

**TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE (Top performer):**

| Keyword | Old Bid | New Bid |
|---------|---------|---------|
| truffle hot | $0.55 | $1.75 |
| truffle sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |
| gourmet hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.30 |
| small batch hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |

**All Other Manual Campaigns:** Default bid $0.55 → $0.85
**Auto Campaigns:** Default bid → $0.75
**SD-REMARKETING:** Budget $3/day → $6/day (Jan 30) — Hit 10.8K impressions, 72 clicks @ $0.06 CPC. Maxed budget. 2 sales (Hot + Sriracha).

---

## What We've Learned

### Confirmed Wins
- **Truffle dominates**: 63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion — this is the product
- **SRIRACHA AUTO is the #1 PPC campaign**: 21x ROAS, 4.69% ACOS. Auto targeting finding great keywords at $0.17 CPC. Needs way more budget.
- **Auto campaigns quietly outperform manual**: TT-AUTO-CLOSE (24x ROAS), TT-AUTO-SUBS (7x ROAS), SRIRACHA AUTO (21x ROAS) all beat manual campaigns.
- **Truffle S&S coupon = 9:1 return**: 33 clips, 13 redeemed, $210.47 sales on $23.40 total cost.
- **Competitor product targeting works for Truffle**: TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE gets sales by appearing on TRUFF's listing page (33% ACOS).
- **2-packs convert better than singles**: Mild 2-pack (42.7%) vs Mild single (34.9%)
- **PPC works when running**: 10x ROAS on "truffle sauce", 5.6x overall — just need to turn it on
- **Brand searches convert**: "tango hot sauce" = 85% purchase share
- **Post-holiday bid adjustment is critical**: Dec→Jan requires bid increases
- **Phrase match > Exact match**: Phrase finds converting long-tail variations

### Confirmed Failures
- **Bundles are dead**: 648 sessions, $0 revenue across 7 SKUs. DELETED Jan 22, 2026.
- **SD-REMARKETING is a money pit**: $42.68 spent (45% of all ad spend), 156 clicks, ZERO sales. Pause immediately.
- **$3/day campaigns below the bid floor**: 14 TT- campaigns at $3/day got zero impressions.
- **TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE inefficient at scale**: 81% ACOS. Keywords need audit.
- **Flat file SUCCESS ≠ action taken**: Amazon processing confirmation unreliable for relationship changes.
- **Don't fight TRUFF directly**: They own 77K searches for "truff hot sauce" — unwinnable
- **Melinda's conquest doesn't work**: 2,179 impressions, 5 clicks, 0 sales — add as negative

### Mysteries Solved
- **Mango conversion "problem"**: 14.7% is market-rate for category (13.8% average). Not broken.

### Key Gaps Identified
- **"truffle hot sauce" conversion gap**: We get 3% of 17,573 monthly searches but only 1.4% of purchases.
- **Sriracha invisible**: 22% conversion but only 177 sessions total. Outside variation family.

## Competitive Context

**vs TRUFF (main competitor):**
- We WIN on price (16% better value), size (33% more product), health (keto-friendly, carrot-based vs their agave)
- We LOSE on reviews (302 vs 34,744), BSR (#393 vs #6), content quality
- **Strategy**: Don't fight head-on. Position as healthier, better-value alternative.

## SKU Reference

### SKU Generation History
- **Gen 1 (Old):** TCSH, TCSM, TT — original SKUs (mostly gone)
- **Gen 2 (Auto-gen):** GX-ELCK-FRPF, U4-ZJKD-O0BK — Amazon gibberish
- **Gen 3a (Current no-dash):** TRUFFLETANGO, THAITANGO, MANGOTANGO — Amazon barcode (FNSKU required)
- **Gen 3b (Manufacturer barcode):** HOT-TANGO, THAI-TANGO, etc. — no labeling

**EXCEPTION:** TRUFFLETANGO stays active. TRUFFLE-TANGO saved for future own-UPC product.

### Truffle Tango — Jimmy/Truffleist History
Jimmy from The Truffleist owns the UPC on current Truffle label. Collab since 2018 — he sends truffle flavoring, Dan manufactures all units, both sell independently (verbal agreement). Risk: manufacturer barcode = Jimmy's UPC, so Amazon could misassign inventory. Plan: new truffle product with Dan's own branding + UPC.

### Product Lineup Vision
**Core sauces:** 6 flavors × 4 pack sizes (1-pk, 2-pk, 3-pk, 6-pk) = **24 clean listings**
**Future products:** Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk, Chips, Popcorn

---

## Open Questions

- What's the right PPC daily budget ceiling before diminishing returns?
- Should we kill Dragon Jelly (7.7% conversion, $390 total)?
- Should we delete the 5 OOS six-packs (OOS 1-3 years)?
- What's causing the "truffle hot sauce" conversion gap? Price? Images? Reviews vs TRUFF?
