# Tango Amazon — Brain

## Current Understanding

Amazon is the most controllable revenue channel. Currently doing ~$3,500/mo but should be $10,000/mo. The bottleneck is **traffic** — conversion rates are actually fine. PPC is barely running ($66 over 60 days) which is the single biggest untapped lever.

Truffle is the star — 63% of revenue. Mango's 14.7% conversion is market-rate (solved mystery — not a problem).

## What We've Learned

- **Traffic is the bottleneck**, not conversion — sessions are low, conversion is healthy
- **PPC spend is negligible**: ~$33/mo (~$66 over 60 days) — barely a test, let alone a campaign
- **Truffle = 63% of revenue** — the hero SKU, highest margin (70% on Amazon)
- **Mango conversion (14.7%) is market-rate** — was a mystery, now solved. Not underperforming.
- **Amazon margins by flavor**: Truffle 70% > Sriracha 63% > Mild 55% > Thai 54% > Hot 53%
- SD-REMARKETING campaign should be paused (from schedule notes)

## Key Metrics (Jan 2026)

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Monthly revenue | $3,500 | $10,000 |
| PPC spend | ~$33/mo | $300-600/mo |
| Truffle % of revenue | 63% | Maintain |
| Gap to close | $6,500/mo | — |

## Strategy

The path from $3,500 → $10,000 is almost entirely PPC-driven:
1. **Restart PPC at $10-20/day** — Sponsored Products on Truffle first (highest margin hero SKU)
2. **Analyze search term report** — find which keywords convert, cut waste
3. **Optimize Truffle listing** — title, bullets, A+ content for the best-converting SKU
4. **Scale winners** — once ROAS is proven, increase budget
5. **Add Sponsored Brands** — once SP is dialed in, brand-level campaigns for cross-selling

## Open Questions

- What's the right PPC budget to test? $10/day? $20/day?
- Which keywords to target for Truffle? Need search term report analysis
- Should we run Sponsored Brands or just Sponsored Products first?
- What's the current ACOS and ROAS on the tiny existing spend?
- Are there any keyword rankings to protect/build on?
- What seller fees are we actually paying? Need real number for margin calculation

## Goal

**This month:** Restart PPC campaigns, optimize Truffle listing, grow traffic
**12 months:** $10,000/mo (25% of total revenue target)

## Intel (Time-Sensitive)

**Amazon PPC Quick Reference:**
- Start with Sponsored Products (easiest, most data)
- Auto campaigns first to mine keywords, then manual campaigns to target winners
- Target ACOS: 25-35% for hot sauce category
- Truffle should be the lead SKU (highest margin = most room for ad spend)
- Budget $10-20/day = $300-600/mo — still conservative but 10x current spend
