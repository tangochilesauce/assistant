# Tango x Amazon — Brain

**Target:** $10,000/month | **Current:** $3,500/month | **Gap:** $6,500
**Weight:** 25%

---

## My Current Understanding

Amazon is Tango's biggest revenue driver. Truffle dominates (63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion). Traffic is the bottleneck, not conversion.

**Status (Feb 20):** PPC running since Dec 14. Feb 20 campaign report (cumulative): 8 active campaigns, $159 spent, $497 sales, 3.12x ROAS overall. SD-REMARKETING paused (was 45% of spend, 0 sales). SRIRACHA AUTO budget raised to $25/day (29x ROAS). TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE budget raised to $20/day (4.6x ROAS). Both S&S coupons renewed Feb 20: Truffle S&S (proven $226 winner) + new Sriracha S&S test. 3 new test campaigns launching: TT-CATEGORY, TT-HOT-HONEY, Pepper Plant PT. Variation family still needs Seller Support call (HOTT2 won't attach).

## Jan 30 Bid Overhaul — COMPLETED

**Root cause found:** Bids were $0.45-$0.55 while Amazon suggested $1.25-$3.38. Post-holiday search volume dropped + competition adjusted = we stopped winning auctions.

### Key Bid Changes

**TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE (Top performer):**

| Keyword | Old Bid | New Bid |
|---------|---------|---------|
| truffle hot | $0.55 | $1.75 |
| truffle sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |
| gourmet hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.30 |
| small batch hot sauce | $0.55 | $1.40 |

**All Other Manual Campaigns:** Default bid $0.55 → $0.85
**Auto Campaigns:** Default bid → $0.75
**SD-REMARKETING:** Budget $3/day → $6/day (Jan 30) — Hit 10.8K impressions, 72 clicks @ $0.06 CPC. Maxed budget. 2 sales (Hot + Sriracha).

## What We've Learned

### Confirmed Wins
- **Truffle dominates**: 63% of revenue, 38.7% conversion — this is the product
- **SRIRACHA AUTO is the #1 PPC campaign**: 21x ROAS, 4.69% ACOS. Auto targeting finding great keywords at $0.17 CPC. Needs way more budget.
- **Auto campaigns quietly outperform manual**: TT-AUTO-CLOSE (24x ROAS), TT-AUTO-SUBS (7x ROAS), SRIRACHA AUTO (21x ROAS) all beat manual campaigns.
- **Truffle S&S coupon = 9:1 return**: 33 clips, 13 redeemed, $210.47 sales on $23.40 total cost.
- **Competitor product targeting works for Truffle**: TT-PT-COMP-TRUFFLE gets sales by appearing on TRUFF's listing page (33% ACOS).
- **2-packs convert better than singles**: Mild 2-pack (42.7%) vs Mild single (34.9%)
- **PPC works when running**: 10x ROAS on "truffle sauce", 5.6x overall — just need to turn it on
- **Brand searches convert**: "tango hot sauce" = 85% purchase share
- **Post-holiday bid adjustment is critical**: Dec→Jan requires bid increases
- **Phrase match > Exact match**: Phrase finds converting long-tail variations

### Confirmed Failures
- **Bundles are dead**: 648 sessions, $0 revenue across 7 SKUs. DELETED Jan 22, 2026.
- **SD-REMARKETING is a money pit**: $42.68 spent (45% of all ad spend), 156 clicks, ZERO sales. Pause immediately.
- **$3/day campaigns below the bid floor**: 14 TT- campaigns at $3/day got zero impressions.
- **TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE inefficient at scale**: 81% ACOS. Keywords need audit.
- **Flat file SUCCESS ≠ action taken**: Amazon processing confirmation unreliable for relationship changes.
- **Don't fight TRUFF directly**: They own 77K searches for "truff hot sauce" — unwinnable
- **Melinda's conquest doesn't work**: 2,179 impressions, 5 clicks, 0 sales — add as negative

### Mysteries Solved
- **Mango conversion "problem"**: 14.7% is market-rate for category (13.8% average). Not broken.

### Key Gaps Identified
- **"truffle hot sauce" conversion gap**: We get 3% of 17,573 monthly searches but only 1.4% of purchases.
- **Sriracha invisible**: 22% conversion but only 177 sessions total. Outside variation family.

## What We've Tried

| Date | Action | Result | Learning |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Feb 20, 2026 | Coupon audit + renewal | All 7 coupons expired Feb 15-17. Truffle S&S was $226.66/34 clips/14 redeemed (25% budget). Renewed Truffle S&S + created new Sriracha S&S test. | Truffle S&S proven 9:1 return. 5 of 7 coupons were dead weight ($0 sales). Only renew winners. |
| Feb 20, 2026 | Full campaign CSV (cumulative Dec 14 - Feb 20) | 8 active, $159 spent, $497 sales, 3.12x ROAS. SD-REMARKETING paused. Budget increases live on SRIRACHA AUTO ($25), TT-PT-COMP ($20), TT-AUTO-SUBS ($5), TT-AUTO-CLOSE ($5). TT-EXACT-TRUFFLE = 86% ACOS (paused). | Budget increases are serving. Defense targeting = sniper (18% ToS share). 3 new test campaigns planned. |
| Feb 18, 2026 | Full campaign CSV report analyzed | 6 active, $137 spent, $446 sales, 3.24x ROAS. SRIRACHA AUTO 33x, TT-PT-DEFENSE 60x, TT-PHRASE-TRUFFLE 3.8x (biggest earner). SR-PHRASE-TEST and TT-AUTO-LOOSE are losers (pause). | Bids still possibly too low — barely spending daily budgets. Defense targeting is a sleeper hit. |
| Feb 12, 2026 | Full PPC + Coupon + Variation audit | SRIRACHA AUTO = star (21x ROAS). SD-REMARKETING = waste ($42.68/0 sales). Truffle S&S = 9:1 return. | Auto > manual. SD remarketing doesn't work. S&S coupons compound. |
| Feb 11, 2026 | Uploaded v8 variation flat file | Deleted 2 dupes. HOTT2 still won't attach. | Need Seller Support for stubborn catalog issues. |
| Jan 30, 2026 | MAJOR BID OVERHAUL | Raised bids across 18 campaigns. | ROOT CAUSE: Bids were $0.45-$0.55, suggested $1.25-$3.38. |
| Jan 22, 2026 | Launched 13 new PPC campaigns | 12 Truffle + 1 Sriracha test. +$44/day budget. | Phrase match > Exact. Standard negatives: truff, melinda's. |
| Jan 22, 2026 | Deleted 7 bundles | 648 sessions, $0 revenue eliminated | Bundles don't work in hot sauce category. |
| Jan 21, 2026 | PPC Campaign Review | 9 campaigns, 3 paused. 17.86% ACOS, 5.6x ROAS overall. | PPC infrastructure works — just needs budget |
| Jan 20, 2026 | Deep analysis of Business Reports | Found traffic bottleneck, Mango mystery solved | Focus on traffic, not conversion |

## Top Converting Search Terms

| Search Term | Campaign | Impressions | Sales | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| "truffle sauce" | TT-PHRASE | 7,836 | 4 | 10x+ ROAS — WINNER |
| "tango truffle hot sauce" | TT-PHRASE | 63 | 3 | Brand + product |

| B07HMJWCNL (TRUFF ASIN) | TT-PT-COMP | 5,494 | 2 | Competitor conquest |

- "black truffle hot sauce" — lots of impressions, no conversions

## Competitive Context

**vs TRUFF (main competitor):**
- We WIN on price (16% better value), size (33% more product), health (keto-friendly, carrot-based vs their agave)
- We LOSE on reviews (302 vs 34,744), BSR (#393 vs #6), content quality
- **Strategy**: Don't fight head-on. Position as healthier, better-value alternative.

## SKU Reference

### SKU Generation History
- **Gen 1 (Old):** TCSH, TCSM, TT — original SKUs (mostly gone)
- **Gen 2 (Auto-gen):** GX-ELCK-FRPF, U4-ZJKD-O0BK — Amazon gibberish
- **Gen 3a (Current no-dash):** TRUFFLETANGO, THAITANGO, MANGOTANGO — Amazon barcode (FNSKU required)
- **Gen 3b (Manufacturer barcode):** HOT-TANGO, THAI-TANGO, etc. — no labeling

**EXCEPTION:** TRUFFLETANGO stays active. TRUFFLE-TANGO saved for future own-UPC product.

### Truffle Tango — Jimmy/Truffleist History
Jimmy from The Truffleist owns the UPC on current Truffle label. Collab since 2018 — he sends truffle flavoring, Dan manufactures all units, both sell independently (verbal agreement). Risk: manufacturer barcode = Jimmy's UPC, so Amazon could misassign inventory. Plan: new truffle product with Dan's own branding + UPC.

### Product Lineup Vision
**Core sauces:** 6 flavors × 4 pack sizes (1-pk, 2-pk, 3-pk, 6-pk) = **24 clean listings**
**Future products:** Dragon Jelly, Gobblins, Mega Jerk, Chips, Popcorn

### Pricing Structure
**Singles:** Hot $10, Mild $10, Mango $10, Thai $10, Truffle $17
**2-Packs:** Hot $18, Mild $18, Mango $18, Thai $18, Truffle $30
**6-Packs:** Hot $40, Mild $40, Mango $40, Thai $40, Truffle $75

### Bundle Concepts (Bundles DELETED Jan 22 — 648 sessions, $0 revenue)
*Historical reference only — bundles confirmed dead in hot sauce category*
- Original Flavors: 1 Hot + 1 Mild — $18
- Heat Seekers: 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $18
- Starter Sauce: 1 Mild + 1 Mango — $18
- New Flavors: 1 Thai + 1 Mango — $18
- Heat Range: 1 Mild + 1 Hot + 1 Thai — $26
- Tango Sampler: 1 Hot + 1 Mild + 1 Mango + 1 Thai — $34
- Party of 5: 1 each of all — $40

---

## Open Questions

- What's the right PPC daily budget ceiling before diminishing returns?
- Should we kill Dragon Jelly (7.7% conversion, $390 total)?
- Should we delete the 5 OOS six-packs (OOS 1-3 years)?
- What's causing the "truffle hot sauce" conversion gap? Price? Images? Reviews vs TRUFF?
