# Tango Amazon — Brain

## Current Understanding

Amazon is the most controllable revenue channel. Currently doing ~$3,500/mo but should be $10,000/mo. The bottleneck is traffic — conversion rates are actually fine. PPC is barely running ($66 over 60 days) which is the biggest untapped lever.

Truffle is the star — 63% of revenue. Mango's 14.7% conversion is market-rate (not a problem, was a mystery).

## Goal

**This month:** Restart PPC campaigns, optimize Truffle listing
**12 months:** $10,000/mo

## Key Metrics

- Current revenue: ~$3,500/mo
- Truffle: 63% of revenue
- PPC spend: ~$33/mo (way too low)
- Amazon seller fees: unknown (need real number)

## Open Questions

- What's the right PPC budget to test? $10/day? $20/day?
- Which keywords to target for Truffle?
- Should we run Sponsored Brands or just Sponsored Products?

## Pipeline

- [ ] Restart PPC campaigns
- [ ] Truffle title + bullet optimization
- [ ] Analyze search term report
