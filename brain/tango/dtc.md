# Tango DTC — Brain

## Current Understanding

Direct-to-consumer sales are currently $0. This is an untapped channel with real potential — we have an email list and a website that just need to be activated.

**The Email Situation:** Dan previously used Klaviyo for email marketing, but deliverability tanked so badly that most subscribers weren't even seeing the emails. The cost couldn't be justified given the poor reach, so the service was cancelled. At that time, domain authentication/DNS settings (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) were updated, but haven't been checked in months. The list itself still exists — it's dormant, not dead.

**14-Day Sprint Plan (Feb 14-28):** Redesign the Tango website, hit the email list, and drive direct sales within days. This is a sprint priority.

## What We've Learned

- Klaviyo deliverability was destroyed — likely due to domain reputation, list hygiene, or authentication issues
- Domain DNS was updated when Klaviyo was cancelled, but needs re-verification before sending again
- Email list is dormant — needs a re-engagement strategy, not just a blast
- Cost of email platform matters when deliverability is low (Klaviyo was too expensive for the open rates)

## Open Questions

- What's the current email list size? How old is it? When was the last send?
- What domain is sending from? tangochilesauce.com? What's the current SPF/DKIM/DMARC status?
- Is the Shopify store set up and ready, or does the website need a rebuild?
- What email platform to use next? (Mailchimp free tier? Brevo? Loops? MailerLite?)
- DTC pricing strategy — same as Amazon? Higher? Bundle deals?
- What's the re-engagement plan? Warm the list first or go straight to a sale?
- Social media following / other traffic sources to pair with email?

## What We've Tried

- Klaviyo for email marketing — cancelled due to poor deliverability + high cost (date unknown, months ago)
- Updated domain DNS settings (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) when Klaviyo was cancelled — haven't verified since

## Short-Term Goal

**This month (Feb 2026):** Redesign website → hit email list → drive first direct sales

## Long-Term Goal

**12 months:** $5,000/mo DTC revenue stream
