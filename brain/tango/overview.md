# Tango Chile Sauce — Brain

## Current Understanding

Tango is a premium hot sauce brand with 6 flavors: Sriracha, Mango, Truffle, Mild, Thai, Hot. Revenue comes through multiple channels — Amazon (direct), UNFI (distribution to Whole Foods, etc.), EXP Corp, and emerging channels (Costco, DTC, Faire, Mable).

The business is real and generating ~$6,900/mo but the goal is $50K/mo by Q2 2026. The gap is $43,100/mo.

Production happens at Foodies (co-packing) with ingredients from Deep. Packaging from Acorn (boxes) and labels. Shipping via Daylight.

**Channel vs Key Account distinction:** A "Channel" means you invoice them directly (Amazon, UNFI, Costco, EXP, Faire, Mable). A "Key Account" means they order through a distributor (e.g., Whole Foods orders via UNFI).

## The Origin Story (Short)

When grandma first crafted her legendary chile in 1940s Honduras, she started with seven simple ingredients — most growing right outside her home. It started in her youth with a wild Scotch Bonnet plant that produced peppers every season.

It stayed small and honest at first — just family, neighbors, and friends. Then she started bottling it for the local market, where it took off. For a few bright years it lived out in the world, until she came to America and the recipe went quiet.

In 2015, she showed Dan her chile for the first time and it was over. He became obsessed. She showed him how to make it and he started making it naturally for himself, then for friends, then for stores, and Tango was born.

### Cold-Fill Certification
Worked with food scientists at Cornell University for over a year to achieve FDA shelf-stability in a plastic squeeze bottle without preservatives (no sodium benzoate, sodium bisulfite, potassium sulfide, potassium sorbate, xanthan gums). This is a key competitive advantage — convenience without compromise.

## Competitor Positioning

| Competitor | Our Advantage |
|-----------|---------------|
| TRUFF | Keto-friendly (they use agave), better value $/oz |
| Melinda's | Premium quality, authentic Keto |
| Yellowbird | We lead with truffle premium |

## What We've Learned

- **Traffic is the bottleneck on Amazon**, not conversion — PPC barely running ($66/60d)
- **Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue** — the star SKU
- **Mango mystery SOLVED**: 14.7% conversion is market-rate, not a problem
- **UNFI SoPac (LA) = WHERE THE GROWTH IS**: +516% YoY
- **UNFI Northeast = declining**: -9% YoY — needs Mango SKU expansion
- **Mango adds ~7 units/week net** at Whole Foods (34 new - 27 cannibalized)
- **Whole Foods sell-through**: SoPac (Hot 40%, Mango 33%, Mild 27%), NE (Hot 57%, Mild 43%)
- **Hot is the #1 seller** at Whole Foods across both regions
- **Klaviyo killed DTC email deliverability** — stale DNS records still haunting the domain
- **Shopify Email is the DTC play** — 10K free/mo, native, no branding

## COGS & Margins

| Flavor | COGS | UNFI Margin | Best Channel |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|
| Sriracha | $2.74 | — | EXP 34%, Amazon 63% |
| Mango | $3.31 | **31%** | Best UNFI margin (high yield) |
| Truffle | $3.34 | — | EXP 60%, Amazon 70% |
| Mild | $3.37 | 30% | Amazon 55% |
| Thai | $3.42 | — | Amazon 54% |
| Hot | $3.49 | 28% | Amazon 53% |

## Production System

### Conversion Ratios
| Unit | Conversion |
|------|-----------|
| 1 drum (bote) | ~625 bottles |
| 1 case | 6 bottles |
| 1 cook shift (4hr) | 3 ollas |
| 1 pack shift (4hr) | ~1,000 bottles |

### Olla Yields (CONFIRMED Feb 2026)
Ollas are 45-gallon pots filled to within 3-6 inches from the top.

| Flavor Group | Batches/Olla | Bottles/Olla |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hot/Mild/Truffle/Thai/Sriracha | 4 batches | **~400** |
| Mango | 2 (larger batches) | **~450** |

**Key distinction:** 1 olla ≠ 1 drum. A drum holds ~625 bottles. A standard olla yields ~400 bottles — roughly 2/3 of a drum. Mango yields ~450 (2 larger batches, higher volume per batch).

### Process Flow
Ingredients → Batches → Ollas (cook) → Drums (cool 2 days) → Bottles (pack) → Cases

### Data Source
All production data lives in Supabase settings table (keys: `tango_production_*`). **PL8 Orders page (`assistant-k5go.vercel.app/orders`) is the single source of truth** — editable directly (packed counts, drum counts, status pills, ingredient inventory, bill plans, material status). Standalone Tango Dashboard is retired. Notion "Tango Production" page is also retired.

## Channel Revenue Targets

| Channel | Target | Current | Gap | Weight |
|---------|--------|---------|-----|--------|
| Amazon | $10,000 | $3,500 | $6,500 | 25% |
| UNFI | $10,000 | $3,400 | $6,600 | 25% |
| Costco | $5,000 | $0 | $5,000 | 15% |
| DTC | $5,000 | $0 | $5,000 | 5% |
| **Total Tango** | **$30,000** | **$6,900** | **$23,100** | 65% |

## Key Contacts

| Lauren Martinez | Erewhon | Brand Management | Warm lead from 2022 |
| Brittney Langlois | UNFI | UpNext SDM | Monthly check-ins |

## Current Blockers

| Channel | Blocker | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Amazon | PPC barely running ($66/60d) | Traffic starved, $6,500 gap |
| UNFI NE | John Lawson response needed | Can't expand Mango into Northeast |
| UNFI | Endless Aisle paperwork incomplete | Online distribution blocked |
| DTC | Stale Klaviyo DNS records | Email deliverability broken |
| DTC | Email list dormant | Need to export, clean, warm up |

## Orders System (NEXT BUILD)

**Goal:** Full order lifecycle management on PL8 Orders page

### What We Need
1. **Supabase `orders` table** — id, channel, po_number, value, date, stage (new/processing/shipped/paid), doc paths (po_url, bol_url, inv_url), notes
2. **Migrate dashboard from localStorage → Supabase** — same pipeline UI, persistent data
3. **Drop zone for new POs** — drag PDF onto box, auto-scan/parse, create folder, create order card
4. **Document export links** — PO, BOL, Invoice buttons on each card link to actual files
5. **Existing folder:** `/Projects/🔥 tango/orders-invoices/` already has channel subfolders

### Architecture
- Order DATA → Supabase (stage, value, dates, doc URLs)
- Order FILES → Local folders (PDFs on machine, organized by channel/PO)
- PL8 Orders page reads from Supabase
- Drop zone: browser-side file handling → parse → create folder → insert row

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Feb 8, 2026 | Replaced numbered folder system with project-based folders mirroring Notion sub-pages | Old system organized by lifecycle stage but didn't match how we work — by project/channel |
| Feb 8, 2026 | Moved financial statements from tango/ to dan/financial | Financial statements are personal/company-wide, not Tango-specific |
| Jan 19, 2026 | Position Truffle Tango as "The Healthy Truffle Hot Sauce" | TRUFF uses agave (not Keto), Melinda's falsely claims Keto. We own this space legitimately. |
| Jan 19, 2026 | Organize workspace by brand → channel (e.g., /tango/amazon/) | Brands are the entities, channels are how they sell. Scales better. |

## Production Planning — How To Do This (Feb 2026)

This is the process for figuring out what to cook. PL8 Orders page handles most of this now but verify with Dan:

### Step 1: Gather All Active Orders
Pull every PO that's in "processing" or "new" stage. Check:
- PL8 Orders page (Supabase `tango_orders` table)
- Plate drop folder for new POs not yet added to dashboard
- Note the pickup dates — separate near-term vs later orders

### Step 2: Total Bottles Needed by Flavor
For each order, multiply cases × 6 = bottles. Sum across all orders per flavor.

### Step 3: Count Real Inventory
**Don't trust the dashboard defaults** — ask Dan for actual counts. Need:
- Filled bottles by flavor (already packed, ready to go)
- Drums by flavor (sauce made but not yet bottled)
- Half drums count as ~200 bottles (half of 400, NOT half of 625)
- Already-built pallets are DONE — subtract those orders from the need

### Step 4: Calculate Gap
Gap = Total Need − Bottles on hand − Drum bottle equivalents
Negative gap = short, need to cook. Positive = covered.

### Step 5: Plan Ollas
- Standard ollas (Hot/Mild/Truffle/Thai/Sriracha): ~400 bottles each
- Mango ollas: ~450 bottles each (2 larger batches)
- 1 cook shift = 3 ollas max (4 hours, $400)
- Prioritize by pickup date urgency

### Step 6: Build Ingredient Order for Deep
Use the per-olla ingredient lists below. Scale by number of ollas per flavor.
**IMPORTANT:** Break down per-batch needs FIRST, then total across all ollas, THEN round up to purchasable units. Check for tight spots (where rounding down leaves you short) before finalizing the list. Garlic and lime juice are the most common tight spots when scaling down from the 3-olla reference.

We offer 6 exceptional flavors — Hot (the original), Mild (less heat), Truffle (hint of truffle), Mango (sweet and fruity), Thai (extra hot), and Sriracha (clean simple Sriracha). 100% clean ingredients, carrot-based, packed with nutrients, no sugar, and no preservatives.

### Differentiation Copy
The main difference that puts Tango above the rest is the flavor. There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise.

## The Full Origin Story

Since childhood, Dan always enjoyed the staple condiments and sauces, but it was in college that his love for spiciness and hot sauce took full bloom. His mom — born in Central America and raised on spicy cuisine — sneered at his American brands of sauce and told him just wait until he tries grandma's 'chile'. It wasn't until 2013 that she actually made a batch and he got to try it. It blew his mind.

After a dozen batches, he ended up with his own version of her recipe. When friends tried it they went crazy for it, and when people wanted to buy quantity, he started taking things seriously. He was working as a graphic/web designer in NYC, so it was easy enough to find jars on Amazon, design a logo, print labels at home, launch on Shopify, and blast social media. 10 jars sold the first day, another 10 over the next month. But sales continued and feedback was always positive.
