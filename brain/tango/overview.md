# Tango Chile Sauce — Brain

## Current Understanding

Tango is a premium hot sauce brand with 6 flavors: Sriracha, Mango, Truffle, Mild, Thai, Hot. Revenue comes through multiple channels — Amazon (direct), UNFI (distribution to Whole Foods, etc.), EXP Corp, and emerging channels (Costco, DTC, Faire, Mable).

The business is real and generating ~$6,900/mo but the goal is $50K/mo by Q2 2026. The gap is $43,100/mo.

Production happens at Foodies (co-packing) with ingredients from Deep. Packaging from Acorn (boxes) and labels. Shipping via Daylight.

## Goal

**This month:** Ship EXP pallet, fix Amazon PPC, close DTC sales
**12 months:** $30,000/mo across Amazon + UNFI + Costco + DTC

## Key Learnings

- Traffic is the bottleneck on Amazon, not conversion
- PPC barely running (~$66 over 60 days) — massive untapped lever
- Truffle = 63% of Amazon revenue
- Mango mystery SOLVED: 14.7% conversion is market-rate
- UNFI SoPac (LA) is WHERE THE GROWTH IS: +516% YoY
- UNFI Northeast needs SKU expansion (no Mango)
- Mango adds ~7 units/week net at Whole Foods
