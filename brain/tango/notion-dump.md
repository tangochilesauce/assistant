## Dan's Personal Pitch (Bio)
```
Hey all, Dan here! Tango is my brand, I made my first batch in 2013 in
my tiny apartment in NYC, just trying to make my own blend of my grandma's
famous 'chile' that she used to make for her neighbors and friends in
Honduras. I designed the logo, built the website, put it in the bottle,
everything. 9 years and 6 flavors later, I still uphold the same ingredient
list and values that she promoted in her original creation. All clean,
delicious ingredients, no sugar or preservatives. Tango is a family
business, a labor of love. I still own 100% of the business, there are
no investors involved. We wake up and eat Tango and then get to work
making it. We love it, and we love anybody who loves it.. and that's everybody!

# CUSTOMER REVIEWS

> "Bought the hot sauce on a whim at Smorgasburg. Oh my god! It has honestly become the most used 'spice' in the house. My son loves all things hot. But Tango is his go-to for sandwiches, burgers, etc. My daughter hates all things hot. Until this sauce." — **Mindya Owne, Facebook**

> "Are you kidding? Usually you take a bland food and add spices... with tango, you start with tango and say what can I add to this?" — **Mitch Rosenthal, Facebook**

> "It's got an awesome flavor with garlic and peppers at the forefront. Does not have a vinegar taste. Very mild heat, but the flavor is one of my new favorites." — **Annie, Amazon**

> "Awesomely spicy without the sugar. Bought it for Whole30 and will be buying more." — **Amazon Review**

> "This is delicious hot sauce! It tastes like it's habanero based which adds a yummy complexity. I got this as a sample from a James Beard event in the Hamptons. For those from NYC who love Dos Toro's, this is exactly like the super hot sauce they use." — **Birdie NYC, Amazon**

> "This stuff is the nectar of hades, its ingredients chosen from the garden of eden and made from the same chilis that the aztecs used as currency. This is the sauce that all other sauces aspire to become." — **Jordan Rapaport, Facebook**

> "I've been enjoying this for years, it's about time I thanked you. Thank you for making this incredibly complimentary condiment!" — **JonnyJersey, Amazon**

> "Couldn't put it down! I eat it on EVERYTHING! 10 out of 10... would recommend." — **Lisa Renkel, Facebook**

> "Just had my first taste, and boy was it good!! I had the Mild flavor and it really complimented my meal. I don't usually put hot sauce on my foods, but thanks to Tango Chile I definitely will be!" — **Christopher Dutz, Facebook**

# BRAND COPY

## Short Description
"Tango is crazy good spicy flavor in a plant-based chile sauce, made from grandma's recipe using 100% clean ingredients in a convenient 8oz squeeze bottle, perfect for adding delicious spicy flavor to your favorite foods."

## Detailed Description
"The main difference that puts Tango above the rest is the flavor. There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise."

## Key Selling Points (Master List)
Carrot-Based, Vegan, No Preservatives, No Sugar, No Gums, Plant-Based, Organic Ingredients, 6 Incredible Spicy Flavors, 100% Clean Ingredients, Easy-To-Use Squeeze Bottle, Handmade in Small Batches in CA, Grandma's Recipe, Born in Brooklyn, Rich In Vitamins, Gluten-Free, American Made, Family-Owned, Independent, Good on Everything, 98%+ sell-through rate, Cold-fill certified

## Deep Tango Speech (Dan's Philosophy)
"There may be no more pursuit more shared by all walks of life than eating. Hot sauce, makes eating, better. Ideally in 5 ways: Adds flavor to your food, enhances all the flavors in the food, adds color, introduces spice-heat (a nervous system excitement mechanism). Hot sauce is also kind of a solidy liquid or a liquidy solid. It has pour physics. It incorporates so many qualities of the universe — Nature, Physiology, Sensation, Temperature, Physics, Flow, Chemistry, Fire, Flavor, Eating, Fun, Courage, Experience."

## Tagline Ideas
- "Choose discomfort."
- "There's billions of tango fans most just haven't tried it yet"
- "The only hot sauce you crave more than the food u put it on"
- "Sauce so good it hurts"
- "Flavor heaven"
- "High quality Chile sauce"

# DECISIONS LOG

|------|----------|-----------|
| Feb 8, 2026 | Replaced numbered folder system with project-based folders | Old system organized by lifecycle stage but didn't match how we work — by project/channel |
| Feb 8, 2026 | Moved financial statements from tango/ to dan/financial | Financial statements are personal/company-wide, not Tango-specific |
| Jan 19, 2026 | Position Truffle Tango as "The Healthy Truffle Hot Sauce" | TRUFF uses agave (not Keto), Melinda's falsely claims Keto. We own this space. |
| Jan 19, 2026 | Organize workspace by brand → channel | Brands are entities, channels are how they sell. Scales better. |
| Jan 2026 | Focus PPC on Truffle | 63% of revenue, highest margin |
| Jan 2026 | Prioritize SoPac over Northeast | +516% YoY growth there |
