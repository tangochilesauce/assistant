# Tango x UNFI — Brain

**Target:** $10,000/month | **Current:** $3,400/month | **Gap:** $6,600
**Weight:** 25%

---

## My Current Understanding

UNFI is Tango's wholesale distribution channel, getting us into grocery stores via two distribution centers: Moreno Valley (SoPac/LA) and Hudson Valley (Northeast/NYC). We're in the UpNext emerging brands program.

**Status:** SoPac is growing +516% YoY. Northeast needs SKU expansion (no Mango). Endless Aisle paperwork blocking new store access.

### UpNext Crisis Context
On **May 21, 2025**, Brittney sent a termination notice. UpNext is a 2-year program — we've been in it since 2018 (7 years). Reason: "not meeting sales thresholds for graduation." Decision reversed May 22 after Dan's response. Monthly check-ins established. **The $10K/month goal isn't just nice-to-have, it's survival.**

### Core Philosophy: Density Before Scale
"Store count is vanity. Velocity is sanity." Brands that dominate two distribution centers before expanding have 3-4x better outcomes. Current WF velocity: ~1.6 units/store/week. Target: 3+ units/store/week = 2x current sales without adding stores.

---

## Goals

| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| **This Month** | Get to $10K/month ASAP |
| **12 Months** | Graduate from UpNext ($300K annual) |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Monthly Revenue | $3,400 | $10,000 | $6,600 |
| SoPac YoY | +516% | Maintain | --- |
| Northeast YoY | -9% | +20% | Needs Mango |
| Store Count | ~50 | 200+ | +150 |
| WF Velocity | ~1.6 units/store/week | 3+ | 2x needed |

└── New Store Outreach ──────────────── 50%
    ├── LA/SoCal (65%) ← WHERE THE GROWTH IS

## Revenue Math

| Source | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Existing WF velocity | $3,400 | $4,500 | +$1,100 |
| WF SKU expansion (John Lawson) | $0 | $2,000 | +$2,000 |
| WF new regions (John Lawson) | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |
| New LA chains | $0 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |
| New NYC chains | $0 | $500 | +$500 |
| **Total** | **$3,400** | **$10,000** | **+$6,600** |

## Why LA First?

| Region | WF Stores | YoY Growth |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| SoPac (LA) | 48 | **+516%** |
| Northeast (NYC) | 53 | **-9%** |

LA is exploding. NYC is shrinking. **Go where the momentum is.**

## In-Store Demo Strategy

Demos boost same-day sales up to **475%**. Velocity stays elevated **1.3x for 3-4 weeks**. **1.1x permanent lift** from converted loyal customers. Cost: ~$250-400 per demo session.

## Distribution Centers

| DC | Location | Vendor # | SKUs |
|----|----------|----------|------|
| Moreno Valley | Riverside, CA | L-086208 | Hot, Mild, Mango |

**NOT in UNFI:** Truffle, Thai, Sriracha

## Blockers

| What's Blocked | Why | Unblock Action |
|---------------|-----|----------------|
| Northeast SKU expansion | Waiting on John Lawson | Follow up (emailed Jan 20) |
| New store access | Endless Aisle forms incomplete | Complete 8 forms |
| UpNext status | Almost dropped May 2025 | Monthly check-ins with Brittney |

- [ ] Monthly check-in with Brittney → UpNext status, show growth

### MOR (Moreno Valley) — New Store Targets

## What We've Learned

### Confirmed Wins
- **LA is the growth engine**: SoPac +516% YoY vs Northeast -9% YoY
- **Top LA performers**: Venice +396%, Downtown LA +1,201%, Glendale +364%, Santa Barbara +792%
- **Mild is growing**: +20.6% YoY at Whole Foods
- **Mango is trending**: +63% YoY — smallest but fastest growing
- **Already in UNFI**: Makes new store outreach seamless ("We're already in UNFI, fulfillment is seamless")

### Confirmed Failures
- **Truffle, Thai, Sriracha not in UNFI**: Can't sell what's not in the system
- **Hudson Valley doesn't carry Mango**: Limits Northeast growth
- **NYC outreach without SKU expansion is limited**: Hot + Mild only in HV

### Clarified (Jan 2026)
- **Endless Aisle ≠ adding new products** — It's supplier paperwork/catalog updates for existing warehouse SKUs
- **Endless Aisle is regional** — Products only visible to stores served by the DC where stocked
- **To add new SKUs to UNFI** — Requires separate pitch to rep, approval, item setup docs, inventory shipment
- **Food safety audit workaround works** — Promissory notes accepted (done 2017, 2024, now 2026)
- **Sriracha 6-pack UPC not registered in GS1** — Would need to create before UNFI submission

### Historical Context
- Aug 2022: Erewhon said "everyone loves the taste" but rejected on packaging design
- Sep 2025: Re-reached Erewhon with new packaging, got routed to vendor portal
- May 2025: Almost dropped from UpNext — reversed after response
- Dan was behind The Truffleist brand (NE Whole Foods run) — relevant for truffle velocity proof

## What We've Tried

| Date | Action | Result | Learning |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Jan 20, 2026 | Emailed John Lawson re: full lineup | Awaiting response | Follow up Jan 27 |
| Sep 2025 | Re-contacted Erewhon | Routed to vendor portal | Portal needs Non-GMO cert (may be flexible) |
| Aug 2022 | Initial Erewhon outreach | Taste loved, packaging rejected | New packaging addresses this |
| May 2025 | Responded to UpNext termination notice | Decision reversed | Brittney is invested, need to show growth |

## Open Questions

- What's John Lawson's actual decision-making timeline for SKU expansion?
- Is Erewhon's Non-GMO requirement hard or flexible?
- Should we prioritize chain HQ outreach or independent store blitz first?
- What's the right demo strategy — which stores, how many per month?
- When does Brittney expect us to hit graduation thresholds?
- **Should we get into KeHE?** Erewhon uses KeHE. Would open that door but adds distributor complexity.
