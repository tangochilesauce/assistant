# Tango Sales — Brain

**Sales expansion strategy, store targets, pitch templates, outreach.**

---

## My Current Understanding

Sales expansion happens through two paths: (1) Distribution — getting into new chains via UNFI or direct relationships, and (2) DTC/B2B — Faire, Mable, website, social. The 10 best supermarket targets have been identified. We have a library of proven pitch templates from years of outreach.

in that part of town to you to pick up Tango. We have 6 flavors - all
sell very well. Can I send you a variety pack of 25 to start? If for any
reason you are not satisfied with sales in 30 days, we will come collect

## Tango Brand Description (Short)
"Tango is crazy good spicy flavor in a plant-based chile sauce, made from grandma's recipe using 100% clean ingredients in a convenient 8oz squeeze bottle, perfect for adding delicious spicy flavor to your favorite foods."

## Tango Brand Description (Detailed)
"The main difference that puts Tango above the rest is the flavor. There is something fundamentally special in the combination of these particular ingredients that simply doesn't exist elsewhere in the market. Tango is complementary without overpowering. Additionally, there is nothing unhealthy about Tango. It's plant-based, there's no sugar, no preservatives, yet still available in a convenient plastic squeeze bottle. Unlike most hot sauces, we're cold-fill certified, which means we're able to achieve shelf-stability in a squeeze bottle without the addition of any artificial preservatives. Convenience without compromise."

## Dan's Origin Story (Long Form)
"Hey all, Dan here! Tango is my brand, I made my first batch in 2013 in my tiny apartment in NYC, just trying to make my own blend of my grandma's famous 'chile' that she used to make for her neighbors and friends in Honduras. I designed the logo, built the website, put it in the bottle, everything. 9 years and 6 flavors later, I still uphold the same ingredient list and values that she promoted in her original creation. All clean, delicious ingredients, no sugar or preservatives. Tango is a family business, a labor of love. I still own 100% of the business, there are no investors involved or anything. We wake up and eat Tango and then get to work making it. We love it, and we love anybody who loves it.. and that's everybody!"

## Customer Reviews (Use in Pitches)

> "Bought the hot sauce on a whim at Smorgasburg. Oh my god! It has honestly become the most used 'spice' in the house. My son loves all things hot. But Tango is his go-to for sandwiches, burgers, etc. My daughter hates all things hot. Until this sauce." — **Mindya Owne, Facebook**

> "Are you kidding? Usually you take a bland food and add spices... with tango, you start with tango and say what can I add to this?" — **Mitch Rosenthal, Facebook**

> "It's got an awesome flavor with garlic and peppers at the forefront. Does not have a vinegar taste. Very mild heat, but the flavor is one of my new favorites." — **Annie, Amazon**

> "Awesomely spicy without the sugar. Bought it for Whole30 and will be buying more." — **Amazon Review**

> "This is delicious hot sauce! It tastes like it's habanero based which adds a yummy complexity. I got this as a sample from a James Beard event in the Hamptons. For those from NYC who love Dos Toro's, this is exactly like the super hot sauce they use." — **Birdie NYC, Amazon**

> "This stuff is the nectar of hades, its ingredients chosen from the garden of eden and made from the same chilis that the aztecs used as currency. This is the sauce that all other sauces aspire to become." — **Jordan Rapaport, Facebook**

> "I've been enjoying this for years, it's about time I thanked you. Thank you for making this incredibly complimentary condiment!" — **JonnyJersey, Amazon**
