# Madder — Brain

## Current Understanding

Madder is Dan's music project. Single dropping **Feb 22, 2026**. Currently in the final push — DistroKid upload, studio time at Off Record, building pre-saves to 50+.

This is a creative project with revenue potential but it's weighted at 5% — not the priority, but has a hard deadline this sprint.

## What We've Learned

- Single drops have a hard timeline — DistroKid needs ~5-7 days lead time before release date
- Pre-saves are the key metric before drop day — determines initial algorithmic push
- Off Record studio costs $300 (listed as a debt in Life Admin)
- Sprint deadline: SINGLE DROPS on 2/22

## Key Dates

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Feb 16 | DistroKid upload |
| Feb 17 | Studio @ Off Record |
| Feb 22 | **SINGLE DROPS** 🎸 |

## Strategy

1. **Finish arrangement** — finalize the song structure
2. **DistroKid upload** — get it in the system with enough lead time
3. **Studio session** — record/mix/master at Off Record
4. **Pre-save campaign** — push to 50+ pre-saves before drop day
5. **Release day push** — social media, playlist pitching, personal outreach

## Open Questions

- Is the DistroKid upload done? (was scheduled for Feb 16)
- Did the Off Record studio session happen? (was scheduled for Feb 17)
- What's the current pre-save count?
- Which platforms are we pushing? Spotify, Apple Music, both?
- Any playlist submission strategy?
- Is there album art ready?

## Goal

**This month:** Drop single 2/22, build pre-save to 50+
**12 months:** $5,000/mo (streaming + live + sync licensing)
