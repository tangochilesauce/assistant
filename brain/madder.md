# Madder — Brain

**Target:** Festival performance | **Current:** Building | **Gap:** Define + execute
**Weight:** 15% (2 hours/day dedicated)

---

## My Current Understanding

Madder is a music project. The primary goal isn't money — it's **performing at a major festival** (Coachella-level). Money would come later from streaming, merch, and performance fees.

**The Sound:** Heavy riffs (Deftones influence) + electronic production + hip-hop elements. Hypnotizing chugs, deep distortion, addictive grooves. "New Tool with smooth breakdowns."

**Album:** MADDER — WHERE MY GUYS AT
**Reference:** Deftones — *Around the Fur* (1997, mixed by Terry Date)
**DAW:** Ableton Live 12
**Plugin Suite:** FabFilter + Guitar Rig 7 + Kontakt (Shreddage 3.5 Argent, DjinnBass, Addictive Drums)

**Time allocation:** 2 hours/day dedicated to music. TOP 4 project alongside Amazon, UNFI, and Costco — not because of revenue, but because it feeds the soul.

**Status:** ✅ SINGLE DROPPED 2/22 on YouTube. EP (3-4 tracks) targeting 3/3. Nine days between drops = two marketing events.

---

## Goals

| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| **This Month** | ✅ Debut single dropped 2/22. Drop EP 3/3. |
| **12 Months** | Play Coachella. |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Monthly Revenue | $0 | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| Monthly Listeners | ? | 50,000 | ? |
| Live Shows | ? | 12/year | ? |
| Festival Bookings | 0 | 1 | 1 |

## Release Strategy: 2/22 → 3/3 Rollout

- **2/22** — ✅ DONE. Dropped ONE single on YouTube. The statement piece. "This is what this project sounds like."
- **3/3** — Drop short EP (3-4 tracks). People who found the single now have a project to dig into.
- Two Spotify release events > one album dump from an unknown artist
- Single builds anticipation for EP. 9 days of momentum between drops.
- Two dates to market around instead of one

### Track Concepts (from 30+ grooves)
- Track 1: Black focus vibe, defining riff, build up structure
- Track 2: Hypnotizing chug → Gunna part, 80 BPM
- Track 3: "Depth and Aftertaste" — starts VERY DISTORTED, expands throughout
- *Pick the strongest groove for the 2/22 single. Remaining tracks become the 3/3 EP.*

## What We've Learned

### Confirmed
- **Sound:** Heavy riffs (Deftones) + electronic + hip-hop = hypnotizing chugs, deep distortion
- **Core influence:** Deftones (Elite, Needles and Pins), target vibe: "New Tool with smooth breakdowns"
- **NEW reference:** Black Sabbath — Paranoid sounds even better than ATF as a guitar tone reference
- Goal is festival performance, not just streaming revenue
- This is a passion project that feeds the soul

### Production Breakthroughs (Feb 12, 2026)
- **The 10kHz cliff:** ATF guitar stems have a hard low-pass cutoff at ~10kHz, not a gentle rolloff. Steep LP filter (48dB/octave) at 10k on guitars is the single biggest tone shaping move.
- **Saturation before the cliff:** Saturn 2 (Tape/Warm Tube) BEFORE the low-pass generates harmonics in 3-8kHz that pack tight against the wall. That's the aggression without brightness.
- **The chain that works:** Saturation pushing energy UP → Low-pass chopping it OFF → All energy packs into a tight band between the mid-hump and the cliff.
- **Keyswitches are everything.** Argent articulation changes via MIDI notes below C-1.
- **Velocity variation is critical.** All 127 = machine gun. Vary 60-125 to create dynamics.
- **Skreamer (Tube Screamer) before Gratifier** with gain almost off, level cranked = tighter low end, more mids. The #1 trick.
- **Less amp gain than you think.** Too much = wall of fizz. Skreamer + Saturn do the heavy lifting.

## Tone Bible (Ableton + FabFilter)

### Philosophy
ATF's sonic fingerprint: **thick but not muddy, aggressive but controlled, mid-forward with surprisingly restrained low end.** Not a scooped metal mix — a dense rock mix with weight.

Build order: Drums → Bass → Guitars → Vocals

### The A/B Stem Workflow
We have ATF stems AND MIDI recreations side by side. Calibrate in this order:

1. **Drums first** — MIDI drums matching ATF stems
2. **Bass second** — build on calibrated drums
3. **Guitars last** — if you start here, you'll chase your tail

**Three context tests:**
- Test 1: ATF drums + ATF bass + YOUR guitar → does your guitar sit in the pocket?
- Test 2: YOUR drums + YOUR bass + ATF guitar → is your rhythm section right?
- Test 3: ATF drums + ATF bass + YOUR guitar → is your guitar tone right?

### Kick Drum
**Character:** "Thock" not "boom." Pointed clicky attack (3-5kHz beater), solid punch (150-200Hz), controlled sub.

| Freq | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Below 80Hz | Cut | ATF kick isn't subby |
| 150-200Hz | Boost | Punch zone |
| 300-400Hz | Dip | Remove boxiness |
| 3-6kHz | Narrow boost | Beater click |

Compression: Fast attack (let transient through), medium release, 4-6dB GR. 1176/Distressor style.

### Bass Guitar (Chi Cheng Tone)
**Character:** Warm, round, slightly overdriven but not clanky. Pillowy low-mid foundation. You feel it more than hear it.

| Freq | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| 40-80Hz | Present and solid | "Felt not heard" weight |
| 100-250Hz | Full and round | Chi's zone, wall-of-sound with guitars |
| 500Hz-1kHz | Slightly recessed | Don't compete with Stef's guitar zone |
| Above 2kHz | Mostly gone | No string clank |

Compression: Heavy but transparent. Slow attack, medium release, 6-8dB GR. LA-2A style.
Drive: Warm tube breakup (SansAmp mild). If you can hear it as "distortion" you've gone too far.

### Guitars (Stef Carpenter Tone)

**The "Terry Date Mid-Hump":**

| Freq | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Below 150Hz | Roll off | Bass owns the lows |
| 200-500Hz | Present but controlled | Body / chug territory |
| 800Hz-2kHz | **THIS IS WHERE ATF LIVES** | All the aggression and grind |
| 3-5kHz | Some bite | Presence without harshness |
| Above 6kHz | Roll off | ATF guitars are NOT bright |

**Signal Chain: Argent → Guitar Rig → FabFilter**

*Argent Source:* Bridge pickup, transpose -1st (C#→Drop C), palm mute 35-40% tightness, all built-in FX disabled (raw DI out)

*Guitar Rig 7 — Gratifier (Dual Rectifier):*
1. Noise gate (tight)
2. Green Scream (gain 1-2, level 7-8) — THE #1 TRICK
3. Gratifier: Channel 3, Gain 5.5-6.5, Bass 4-5, **Mid 7-8**, Treble 5-6, Presence 4-5
4. 4x12 V30 cab, mic off-axis

*FabFilter post:*
1. Pro-Q 3 — HP 100-150Hz, dip 300-400Hz, boost 800Hz-2kHz, rolloff above 6kHz
2. Saturn 2 — Tape/Warm Tube, subtle grit → THEN steep LP at 10kHz (48dB/oct)
3. Pro-C 2 — 2-3dB GR, evening dynamics

**Double tracking NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Same riff, different velocities/timing, pan hard L/R.

### The Frequency Handoff

| Zone | Owner |
|------|-------|
| Below ~200Hz | **Bass** (Chi's domain) |
| 200-500Hz | **Both** (intentional overlap = heavy wall) |
| ~500Hz and up | **Guitars** (Stef's domain) |

### Vocal Approach — Three-Layer Hybrid

**Layer 1: Sampled/Processed Vocals** — Take existing vocals (soul, R&B) and recontextualize. Pitch down 2-3 semitones, granular stretch, distortion, long dark reverb.

**Layer 2: Your Own Voice (Processed)** — Whisper or speak lyrics, drown in effects. Layer 5-10 takes. Vocoder. Heavy autotune as aesthetic.

**Layer 3: Screams** — More forgiving than singing. Decent scream + right chain = massive.

**The Chino Insight:** ATF vocals aren't technically virtuosic. What works: singing slightly uncomfortable = natural strain, floating melodic phrases about contour not pitch, whisper→scream contrast, heavy reverb/delay blurring voice and texture.

### FabFilter Plugin Assignments

| Plugin | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Pro-Q 3 | All EQ + spectrum analyzer A/B |
| Pro-C 2 | Compression on tracks + buses |
| Pro-L 2 | Master limiting / loudness matching |
| Pro-R | Room reverb (drums), dark verb (vocals) |
| Saturn 2 | Saturation — drum bus grit, guitar warmth, vocal distortion |
| Pro-G | Gating — kick and tom tightening |
| Pro-MB | Multiband compression |
| Pro-DS | De-essing on processed vocals |

### Other Key Plugins
- DS Tantra — texture and sound design
- Soundtoys Crystallizer — vocal effects, granular delay
- Ohmicide — multiband distortion for aggression
- Analog Lab V — synth textures

### Reference Tracks

| Track | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| My Own Summer (Shove It) | Kick isolation (intro), overall mix density |
| Around the Fur | Guitar tone, bass/guitar handoff |
| Be Quiet and Drive | Dynamic contrast, quiet-to-loud transitions |
| Lhabia | Groove feel, drum character |
| Headup | Low-end weight, aggression |

## Shreddage 3.5 Argent — Keyswitch Map

The 4 you'll use 90% of the time:
- **C#-2** → Mute (chug)
- **E-2** → Power Chord Mute (heavy chug)
- **D#-2** → Power Chord Sustain (let it ring)
- **G-2** → Choke (dead stop)

**That's every Deftones riff: chug chug chug BOOM silence.**

Full map:

| Note | Articulation | ATF Usage |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| C-2 | Sustain | Open riffs, melodic lines |
| C#-2 | **Mute** | THE CHUG — bread and butter |
| D-2 | Staccato | Tight rhythmic hits |
| D#-2 | **Power Chord Sustain** | THE BOOM after the chugs |
| E-2 | **Power Chord Mute** | Heavy low chugs |
| F-2 | Power Chord Staccato | Punchy accents |
| F#-2 | Tremolo | Intensity building |
| G-2 | **Choke** | THE SILENCE — dynamics |
| G#-2 | Tapping | Not really ATF |
| A-2 | Natural Harmonics | Rare — intro textures |
| A#-2 | Artificial Harmonics | Rare |
| B-2 | FX | Rare |

### Velocity Programming

| Articulation | Velocity | Feel |
|-------------|----------|------|
| Palm mute chugs | 80-110 | Varied |
| Open power chord hits | 110-127 | LOUDEST — the payoff |
| Accent notes | 105-115 | Slightly harder |
| Ghost notes | 60-70 | Quiet texture |

Pattern should feel like speech: `100 80 75 105 85 125` not `127 127 127 127 127 127`

### Argent Source Settings (WMGA / ATF Tone)

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Pickup | Bridge | Tight, defined attack |
| Transpose | -1 st | C# default → Drop C |
| Mute Tightness | ~35-40% | Looser ATF chug, not djent |
| Vel → Tightness | Unchecked | Consistent character |
| Anti-Repetition | ON, cranked | Max round robin |
| DI Line Noise | Off | Guitar Rig handles tone |
| Ringing | Unchecked | No sympathetic resonance |
| Built-in FX/Amp/Cab | All disabled | Raw DI out |

## Shit to Try
- [ ] Vocoder or voice synth

## Open Questions

- How much of the album is done? What's left to finish?
- Should we focus on local live shows first to build buzz?
- What's the video strategy for 2026?
- Which smaller festivals should we target before Coachella?
- Do we need a manager/booking agent at some point?
